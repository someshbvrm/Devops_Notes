### **1. AWS Fundamentals & Core Concepts**

**Q1. What is AWS?**
**A:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, content delivery, and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow. It provides on-demand, pay-as-you-go cloud computing platforms and APIs.

**Q2. What are the key advantages of cloud computing?**
**A:** **Cost-Efficiency** (pay-as-you-go, no CapEx), **Scalability** (scale up/down instantly), **Elasticity** (automate scaling), **Reliability** (multiple data centers), **Security** (global secure infrastructure).

**Q3. Explain the differences between CapEx and OpEx.**
**A:** **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)** is upfront spending on physical infrastructure (servers, data centers), which you own and depreciate. **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)** is spending on services and products now, like cloud computing, which is a variable cost. Cloud computing moves IT from CapEx to OpEx.

**Q4. What are the different cloud deployment models?**
**A:** **Public Cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP), **Private Cloud** (your own data center), **Hybrid Cloud** (mix of public and private, e.g., AWS + on-premises).

**Q5. What are the different cloud service models?**
**A:** **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** (e.g., EC2, VPC - you manage OS, apps), **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk, RDS - you manage apps, AWS manages OS), **Software as a Service (SaaS)** (e.g., Salesforce, Gmail - you just use the software).

**Q6. What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?**
**A:** It defines the division of security responsibilities between AWS and the customer.
*   **AWS is responsible for Security *of* the Cloud**: Protecting the infrastructure (hardware, software, networking, facilities).
*   **Customer is responsible for Security *in* the Cloud**: Configuring their services (OS, apps, data, IAM, firewall settings).

**Q7. What is an AWS Region?**
**A:** A physical location in the world where AWS has multiple data centers (Availability Zones). Choose a region based on latency, cost, compliance, and service availability.

**Q8. What is an Availability Zone (AZ)?**
**A:** One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in a Region. They are physically separated to be isolated from disasters.

**Q9. What is an Edge Location?**
**A:** A site that CloudFront uses to cache copies of content for faster delivery to users. They are separate from Regions and AZs.

**Q10. What is the AWS Global Infrastructure composed of?**
**A:** **Regions** -> **Availability Zones (AZs)** -> **Edge Locations & Regional Edge Caches**.

**Q11. How do you interact with and manage AWS services?**
**A:** **AWS Management Console** (Web UI), **AWS CLI** (Command Line Interface), **AWS SDKs** (for programmatic access in various languages), and **Infrastructure as Code tools** like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.

**Q12. What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?**
**A:** It is a PaaS service that automatically handles deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. You just upload your code.

**Q13. What is AWS CloudFormation?**
**A:** It is an IaC service that allows you to model and provision AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates. It creates and manages a collection of resources as a single unit (a stack).

**Q14. What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework?**
**A:** It provides guidance and best practices for designing reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It is based on six pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.

**Q15. What is the AWS Free Tier?**
**A:** It offers free usage of many AWS services for 12 months after sign-up, plus permanent free usage of some services within certain limits.

**... (Questions 16-50 would cover more fundamentals like billing, support plans, and basic architecture principles)** ...

### **2. IAM (Identity and Access Management)**

**Q51. What is IAM?**
**A:** IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

**Q52. What are the core components of IAM?**
**A:** **Users** (people/apps), **Groups** (collection of users), **Roles** (permissions for AWS services/resources), **Policies** (JSON documents that define permissions).

**Q53. What is the difference between an IAM User and an IAM Role?**
**A:** A **User** is a permanent identity for a person or application. A **Role** is a temporary identity assumed by a user, application, or AWS service. Roles do not have long-term credentials (passwords/keys); they provide temporary security credentials.

**Q54. What is an IAM Policy?**
**A:** A JSON document that defines permissions. It specifies what actions are allowed or denied on what resources under what conditions.

**Q55. What is the principle of least privilege?**
**A:** Granting only the permissions required to perform a task. It is a security best practice implemented through fine-grained IAM policies.

**Q56. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?**
**A:** **Authentication** is proving your identity (e.g., logging in with a password/MFA). **Authorization** is what you are allowed to do once authenticated (defined by IAM policies).

**Q57. What is MFA?**
**A:** Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security. It requires users to provide a one-time code from a physical or virtual device in addition to their password.

**Q58. What is an IAM Role used for?**
**A:** Common uses:
*   Granting an EC2 instance permissions to access other AWS services.
*   Allowing users from one AWS account to access resources in another (Cross-Account Access).
*   Granting mobile/app users temporary access to AWS resources (via Web Identity Federation with Amazon Cognito).

**Q59. What is the difference between a resource-based policy and an identity-based policy?**
**A:** An **identity-based policy** is attached to an IAM User, Group, or Role. A **resource-based policy** is attached to a resource (like an S3 bucket or SQS queue) and defines who can access that resource.

**Q60. What is AWS Organizations?**
**A:** A service for managing multiple AWS accounts. It helps you centrally manage billing, control access, compliance, and security. It uses **Organizational Units (OUs)** and **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.

**... (Questions 61-100 would cover policy structure, STS, identity federation, SCPs, and IAM best practices)** ...

### **16. Advanced Architectures & Scenario-Based Questions**

**Q891. How would you design a highly available web application on AWS?**
**A:** Use multiple AZs. Put web servers in an ASG behind an ALB. Use RDS with Multi-AZ. Store static assets in S3 with CloudFront. Use Route 53 for DNS.

**Q892. How would you secure this application?**
**A:** Use Security Groups and NACLs. Use an SSL certificate on the ALB (from ACM). Use WAF and Shield for DDoS protection. Keep instances in private subnets. Use IAM roles for permissions.

**Q893. How would you make it cost-effective?**
**A:** Use Reserved Instances for steady-state workloads (RDS, EC2). Use Spot Instances for stateless, fault-tolerant parts of the ASG. Use S3 lifecycle policies to move old data to cheaper storage classes.

**Q894. A user reports your website is slow. How do you troubleshoot?**
**A:** Check CloudWatch for high latency metrics on the ALB or high CPU on instances. Check if the ASG is scaling properly. Check CloudFront cache hit ratio. Use X-Ray for distributed tracing.

**Q895. How do you implement a disaster recovery strategy?**
**A:**
*   **Backup & Restore:** Cheapest. Regular backups to S3, restore in a new region in case of disaster.
*   **Pilot Light:** Keep a minimal version of your core system (DB) running in a DR region. Scale up quickly when needed.
*   **Warm Standby:** Keep a scaled-down but fully functional version of your app running in the DR region.
*   **Multi-Region Active-Active:** Most expensive. Full deployment in multiple regions, traffic distributed via Route 53.
