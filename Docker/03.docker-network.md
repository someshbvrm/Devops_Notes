# üåê Docker Networking Guide

Docker allows containers to communicate over different network types. Understanding networking is essential for multi-container applications, databases, and microservices.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Docker Network Drivers

| Driver      | Description                                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bridge**  | Default network for containers. Container is accessible to other containers on the same bridge network. |
| **host**    | Container shares the host network stack. Accessible only from the host.                                 |
| **overlay** | Used in Docker Swarm. Allows containers on different hosts to communicate.                              |
| **ipvlan**  | Assigns IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to containers. Useful for L2/L3 networking.                             |
| **macvlan** | Assigns unique MAC addresses to containers. Each container appears as a physical device on the network. |
| **none**    | Container has no network access. Completely isolated.                                                   |

> üí° By default, Docker creates a **bridge network** for every container.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Managing Docker Networks

### Create a Network

```bash
docker network create my-net   # Creates a bridge network named my-net
```

### Inspect a Network

```bash
docker network inspect my-net
```

### List All Networks

```bash
docker network ls
```

### Remove a Network

```bash
docker network rm my-net
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Using Networks with Containers

### Create a Container on a Specific Network

```bash
docker create --name my-nginx --network my-net --publish 8080:8080 nginx:latest
```

> üîπ `--publish 8080:8080` maps container port to host port.

### Attach Network to an Existing Container

```bash
docker network connect my-net my-nginx   # Attach network
docker network disconnect my-net my-nginx # Detach network
```

> ‚ö° Containers on different networks cannot communicate by default. Attach them to the **same network** to enable communication.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Multi-Container Communication

**Scenario:** Tomcat container talking to MySQL container.

### Old Method

* Attach both containers to the **same bridge network**.

### New Method

* Use **overlay network** (recommended for Swarm or multi-host setups).

```bash
docker run --rm -d --network host --name my_nginx nginx
```

> üîπ `-d` ‚Üí Run in detached mode (background)
> üîπ `--rm` ‚Üí Automatically remove container when it stops

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Notes & Best Practices

* **Bridge networks** are ideal for single-host setups.
* **Overlay networks** are necessary for multi-host communication in Swarm.
* Always assign **unique container names** and ports to avoid conflicts.
* Use `docker network inspect <network>` to debug connectivity issues.
* **Security Tip:** Avoid exposing containers directly to host unless necessary (use bridge or overlay).
