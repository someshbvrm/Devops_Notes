### **1. Docker Fundamentals & Core Concepts**

**Q1. What is Docker?**
**A:** Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers. These containers can run anywhere, ensuring consistency across multiple environments.

**Q2. What is a Container?**
**A:** A container is a standardized unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, including libraries, runtime, system tools, and settings. It isolates the application from its surroundings, ensuring it works uniformly regardless of the environment.

**Q3. How is Docker different from a Virtual Machine (VM)?**
**A:**
| Aspect | Virtual Machine (VM) | Docker Container |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Abstraction** | Hardware-level | OS-level |
| **Guest OS** | Full OS on top of hypervisor | Shares the host OS kernel |
| **Size** | Large (GBs) | Small (MBs) |
| **Boot Time** | Minutes | Seconds |
| **Performance** | Lower (overhead of hypervisor) | Near-native |
| **Isolation** | Strong (full process isolation) | Process-level (less strong) |

**Q4. What are the main components of Docker Architecture?**
**A:** The main components are:
1.  **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**: The background service running on the host that manages building, running, and distributing containers.
2.  **Docker Client**: The command-line interface (CLI) that users use to interact with the Daemon.
3.  **Docker Registries**: Services that store Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).
4.  **Docker Objects**: The core building blocks: Images, Containers, Networks, Volumes, Plugins.

**Q5. What is a Docker Image?**
**A:** A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. It is built from a series of layers, defined in a `Dockerfile`.

**Q6. What is a Docker Container?**
**A:** A container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

**Q7. Explain the concept of "Build once, run anywhere" in Docker.**
**A:** Because a Docker container includes everything the application needs to run (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, config files), it can be built on a developer's laptop and then run reliably on any other machine that has Docker installed, such as QA, staging, or production servers.

**Q8. What is the underlying technology that enables containers?**
**A:** Containers are not a Docker-specific technology. They are enabled by core Linux kernel features:
*   **Namespaces**: Provide isolation (PID, network, mount, IPC, UTS, user).
*   **Control Groups (cgroups)**: Limit and measure resources (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Union File Systems (UnionFS)**: Enable the layered image architecture.

**Q9. What is a Docker Hub?**
**A:** Docker Hub is the default public registry provided by Docker. It is a cloud-based repository where users can find and share container images.

**Q10. What is the purpose of `namespaces` in Docker?**
**A:** Namespaces provide isolation for containers. The main types are:
*   **PID namespace**: Process isolation.
*   **Net namespace**: Management of network interfaces.
*   **IPC namespace**: Management of access to IPC resources.
*   **Mount namespace**: Management of filesystem mount points.
*   **UTS namespace**: Isolation of kernel and version identifiers.
*   **User namespace**: Isolation of user and group IDs.

**Q11. What is the purpose of `cgroups` in Docker?**
**A:** Control Groups (cgroups) limit and account for the resource usage of a collection of processes. They control resources like:
*   CPU shares
*   Memory limits
*   Block I/O
*   Network bandwidth

**Q12. What is Union File System (UnionFS)?**
**A:** UnionFS is a filesystem service that allows files and directories of separate filesystems (known as branches) to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent filesystem. Docker uses it to create the layered images, making them efficient and lightweight.

**Q13. What is the difference between a container and an image?**
**A:** An image is a **read-only template** used to create containers. A container is a **runnable instance** of that image. You can have many containers running from the same base image.

**Q14. What is a Docker tag?**
**A:** A tag is a label applied to a Docker image in a repository. It often represents a version (e.g., `ubuntu:20.04`, `my-app:1.2`, `my-app:latest`).

**Q15. What does the `latest` tag mean?**
**A:** The `latest` tag is a conventional tag applied to the most recent build of an image when no specific tag is provided. It does not guarantee that it's the most stable version, just the most recent. It's a best practice to use specific tags in production.

**Q16. What is a multi-stage build in Docker?**
**A:** A multi-stage build allows you to use multiple `FROM` statements in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and you can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another. This helps create smaller, more secure final images by leaving behind only what is needed for production.

**Q17. What is the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction in a Dockerfile?**
**A:** `ENTRYPOINT` configures a container that will run as an executable. It allows you to set the main command of the container, and any arguments passed to `docker run` will be appended to the `ENTRYPOINT` command.

**Q18. What is the `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile?**
**A:** `CMD` provides default arguments for the executing container. There can only be one `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile. If you provide arguments in the `docker run` command, they will override the default specified in `CMD`.

**Q19. Explain the difference between `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`.**
**A:** They work together to define a container's runtime command.
*   `ENTRYPOINT` defines the *command that will be executed*.
*   `CMD` defines the *default arguments* for that command.
*   If both are present, `CMD` arguments are appended to the `ENTRYPOINT` command. If `docker run` specifies arguments, they override `CMD`.

**Q20. What is a `.dockerignore` file?**
**A:** Similar to `.gitignore`, it's a text file that tells the Docker CLI which files and directories to exclude from the build context when building an image. This makes builds faster and images smaller.

**Q21. What is the purpose of the `docker system prune` command?**
**A:** It is a cleanup command that removes all stopped containers, dangling images, unused networks, and build cache. Use `docker system prune -a` to also remove all unused images (not just dangling ones).

**Q22. What is a dangling image?**
**A:** A dangling image is an untagged, unused layer that is not referenced by any other image. They are created when a new build of an image is given the same tag as an older one; the old image becomes "dangling."

**Q23. What is the purpose of the `docker info` command?**
**A:** It displays system-wide information regarding the Docker installation, including the number of containers and images, storage driver in use, kernel version, and total memory.

**Q24. What is the purpose of the `docker inspect` command?**
**A:** It returns low-level information (in JSON format) on Docker objects such as containers, images, volumes, and networks (e.g., configuration, state, IP address, mounts).

**Q25. How can you see the logs of a container?**
**A:** Using the `docker logs <container_name>` command.

**Q26. What is the purpose of the `docker exec` command?**
**A:** It is used to run a command inside a running container. For example: `docker exec -it my_container bash` to get an interactive shell.

**Q27. What does the `-it` flag do in `docker run`?**
**A:** The `-i` (interactive) flag keeps STDIN open, and the `-t` (tty) flag allocates a pseudo-terminal. Together, `-it` allows you to run an interactive shell inside the container.

**Q28. What is the difference between `docker create` and `docker run`?**
**A:** `docker create` creates a new container from an image but **does not start it**. `docker run` creates **and starts** the container.

**Q29. What is the default restart policy for a container?**
**A:** The default policy is `no`, meaning the container will not restart automatically when it exits.

**Q30. What are the available container restart policies?**
**A:**
*   `no`: Do not restart automatically.
*   `on-failure[:max-retries]`: Restart if the container exits with a non-zero status code.
*   `always`: Always restart, regardless of the exit status.
*   `unless-stopped`: Always restart, unless the container was explicitly stopped.

**Q31. How do you remove a stopped container?**
**A:** `docker rm <container_id_or_name>`

**Q32. How do you remove an image?**
**A:** `docker rmi <image_id_or_name>`

**Q33. What is the purpose of a Docker Volume?**
**A:** Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are managed by Docker and exist outside the container's writable layer, making them independent of the container's lifecycle.

**Q34. What is a Bind Mount?**
**A:** A bind mount is a type of mount where a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file/directory is referenced by its absolute path on the host machine.

**Q35. What is the difference between a Volume and a Bind Mount?**
**A:**
| Feature | Named Volumes | Bind Mounts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Host Location** | Managed by Docker (`/var/lib/docker/volumes/`) | User-defined (any path on host) |
| **Portability** | More portable (works on any host) | Less portable (path must exist on host) |
| **Performance** | Varies by OS | Generally good, direct access |
| **Use Case** | Persistent data, sharing between containers | Development, injecting config files |

**Q36. What is `tmpfs` mount?**
**A:** A `tmpfs` mount stores data only in the host machine's memory. It is never written to the host's filesystem, making it very fast but non-persistent (data is lost on container stop).

**Q37. What is the purpose of Docker Networking?**
**A:** Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other, with the host, and with the outside world. It provides isolation and security between different containers.

**Q38. What are the default Docker network drivers?**
**A:**
*   `bridge`: The default network driver for containers that need to communicate on a single host.
*   `host`: Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
*   `none`: Disables all networking for the container.
*   `overlay`: Connects multiple Docker daemons together (for Swarm or multi-host communication).
*   `macvlan`: Allows you to assign a MAC address to a container, making it appear as a physical device on your network.

**Q39. What is the default bridge network in Docker?**
**A:** When you install Docker, it automatically creates a bridge network named `bridge`. Unless you specify another network, new containers are connected to this default bridge network.

**Q40. How do you create a custom network in Docker?**
**A:** `docker network create my-network`

**Q41. What are the advantages of a user-defined bridge network over the default one?**
**A:**
*   **Automatic DNS resolution**: Containers on the same network can resolve each other by name.
*   **Better isolation**: Only containers attached to the same network can communicate.
*   **Configurability**: You can configure the subnet, gateway, and other options.

**Q42. What is Docker Compose?**
**A:** Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. You use a YAML file (`docker-compose.yml`) to configure your application’s services, networks, and volumes.

**Q43. What is the difference between `docker run` and Docker Compose?**
**A:** `docker run` is used to run a single container from the command line. Docker Compose is used to define and run a multi-container application with a single command (`docker-compose up`).

**Q44. What is a Docker Swarm?**
**A:** Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering and orchestration tool. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker host, allowing you to deploy and manage services at scale.

**Q45. What is a Dockerfile?**
**A:** A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. It defines the base image, adds files, sets environment variables, and specifies the command to run.

**Q46. What is the purpose of the `EXPOSE` instruction in a Dockerfile?**
**A:** The `EXPOSE` instruction informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. It does **not** actually publish the port; that is done with the `-p` flag in `docker run`.

**Q47. What is the difference between `ADD` and `COPY` in a Dockerfile?**
**A:**
*   `COPY` is simpler: it only copies local files or directories from the build context into the image.
*   `ADD` has more features: it can also copy from URLs and automatically extract tar files.

**Best Practice:** Use `COPY` unless you specifically need the extra functionality of `ADD`.

**Q48. Why should you avoid running containers as root?**
**A:** For security reasons. If a process inside a container runs as root and a malicious actor breaks out of the container, they could have root privileges on the host machine. It's best to use the `USER` instruction to run as a non-root user.

**Q49. What is a Docker Object?**
**A:** Docker objects are the core entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main objects are: Images, Containers, Networks, Volumes, and Plugins.

**Q50. What is the purpose of the `docker search` command?**
**A:** It allows you to search Docker Hub for images. For example: `docker search nginx`.

### **2. Docker Installation & Configuration**

**Q51. On which operating systems can Docker be installed?**
**A:** Docker can be installed on Linux (various distributions), macOS, and Windows 10/11 (using WSL 2 or Hyper-V).

**Q52. What is Docker Desktop?**
**A:** Docker Desktop is an application for Mac and Windows that provides an easy-to-use GUI for setting up and managing Docker. It includes the Docker daemon, CLI, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes.

**Q53. What is the difference between Docker CE and Docker EE?**
**A:**
*   **Docker Community Edition (CE)**: Free and open-source, aimed at individual developers and small teams.
*   **Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)**: A paid, subscription-based offering with additional features for enterprise development and IT teams, including certified images, support, and advanced management tools. (Note: Docker EE was sold to Mirantis in 2019).

**Q54. How do you configure the Docker daemon?**
**A:** The Docker daemon can be configured using a JSON configuration file, typically located at `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux systems.

**Q55. How can you change the default storage driver for Docker?**
**A:** By specifying it in the `daemon.json` file. For example: `{ "storage-driver": "overlay2" }`.

**Q56. What are the common storage drivers?**
**A:** `overlay2` (recommended for modern Linux kernels), `aufs`, `devicemapper`, `btrfs`, `zfs`.

**Q57. How do you check which storage driver Docker is using?**
**A:** Use the `docker info` command and look for the `Storage Driver` line.

**Q58. Where are Docker images and containers stored on a Linux host?**
**A:** By default, they are stored in `/var/lib/docker/`.

**Q59. How can you change the default storage location for Docker?**
**A:** By changing the `data-root` directive in the `daemon.json` file. E.g., `{ "data-root": "/path/to/new/docker/location" }`.

**Q60. What is the purpose of the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable?**
**A:** It is used to specify the URL of the Docker daemon the client should connect to. This allows you to manage a remote Docker host. E.g., `export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.1.100:2375`.

**... (Questions 61-80 would cover more installation paths, troubleshooting install issues, configuring proxies, etc.) ...**

### **3. Dockerfile Deep Dive**

**Q81. What is the first instruction in a Dockerfile?**
**A:** The `FROM` instruction, which sets the base image for subsequent instructions.

**Q82. What does the `FROM` instruction do?**
**A:** It initializes a new build stage and sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.

**Q83. What is a base image?**
**A:** A base image is the parent image from which your image is built. It is usually a minimal operating system like `alpine`, `ubuntu`, or a language-specific runtime like `node:16`.

**Q84. What is the purpose of the `RUN` instruction?**
**A:** The `RUN` instruction executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results. It is often used to install packages.

**Q85. What is the difference between `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package` and using two separate `RUN` instructions?**
**A:** Combining commands with `&&` in a single `RUN` instruction reduces the number of layers created, making the image smaller. If you use two separate `RUN` instructions, the `apt-get update` layer could become stale and cause a cache miss, leading to installing outdated packages.

**Q86. What is the purpose of the `WORKDIR` instruction?**
**A:** The `WORKDIR` instruction sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. It is the equivalent of `cd` in a shell.

**Q87. Why should you use `WORKDIR` instead of `RUN cd /some/path`?**
**A:** Using `RUN cd` only affects that single layer. Subsequent instructions will start from the default working directory. `WORKDIR` sets the directory persistently for all subsequent instructions.

**Q88. What is the purpose of the `COPY` instruction?**
**A:** The `COPY` instruction copies new files or directories from the build context and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the specified path.

**Q89. What is the purpose of the `ADD` instruction?**
**A:** The `ADD` instruction copies files, directories, or remote file URLs from the build context and adds them to the filesystem of the image. It can also automatically extract local tar archives.

**Q90. When should you use `ADD` over `COPY`?**
**A:** Only when you need its specific features: 1) downloading a remote URL directly, or 2) automatically extracting a local tar file into the image. For all other cases, use `COPY`.

**... (Questions 91-130 would cover other instructions like ENV, ARG, USER, HEALTHCHECK, SHELL, and multi-stage builds in detail) ...**

### **4. Image Management**

**Q131. How do you list all images on your system?**
**A:** `docker images` or `docker image ls`

**Q132. How do you pull an image from a registry without running it?**
**A:** `docker pull <image_name:tag>`

**Q133. How do you push an image to a registry?**
**A:** First, tag it correctly: `docker tag local-image:tag registry-url/repository:tag`. Then push it: `docker push registry-url/repository:tag`.

**Q134. How do you build an image from a Dockerfile?**
**A:** `docker build -t my-image:tag .` (The `.` is the build context path)

**Q135. What is the significance of the `.` in the `docker build` command?**
**A:** The `.` specifies the build context—the set of files located at the specified PATH (often the current directory) that can be referenced by the `COPY` and `ADD` instructions in the Dockerfile.

**Q136. How can you remove all unused images?**
**A:** `docker image prune -a`

**Q137. How can you see the history of an image?**
**A:** `docker history <image_name>`

**Q138. How do you save a Docker image to a tar file?**
**A:** `docker save -o my-image.tar my-image:tag`

**Q139. How do you load an image from a tar file?**
**A:** `docker load -i my-image.tar`

**Q140. What is the difference between `docker save` and `docker export`?**
**A:**
*   `docker save` saves an **image** (with all its layers and metadata) to a tar archive.
*   `docker export` exports a **container's** filesystem (without metadata) to a tar archive.

**... (Questions 141-170 would cover tagging best practices, image signing, inspecting image layers, etc.) ...**

### **5. Container Runtime & Operations**

**Q171. What is the command to run a container?**
**A:** `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`

**Q172. How do you run a container in detached mode?**
**A:** Use the `-d` or `--detach` flag: `docker run -d nginx`.

**Q173. How do you run a container interactively?**
**A:** Use the `-it` flags: `docker run -it ubuntu bash`.

**Q174. How do you list running containers?**
**A:** `docker ps`

**Q175. How do you list all containers (including stopped ones)?**
**A:** `docker ps -a`

**Q176. How do you stop a running container?**
**A:** `docker stop <container_name_or_id>`

**Q177. How do you force stop a container?**
**A:** `docker kill <container_name_or_id>`

**Q178. What is the difference between `docker stop` and `docker kill`?**
**A:** `docker stop` sends a SIGTERM signal, allowing the process to terminate gracefully. `docker kill` sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces an immediate, ungraceful termination.

**Q179. How do you remove a container?**
**A:** `docker rm <container_name_or_id>`

**Q180. How do you remove a running container?**
**A:** Use the `-f` or `--force` flag: `docker rm -f <container_name_or_id>`.

**... (Questions 181-230 would cover port mapping, environment variables, resource limits, restart policies, logging, and common `docker run` flags) ...**

---

### **6. Docker Storage**

**Q231. How do you create a named volume?**
**A:** `docker volume create my-volume`

**Q232. How do you list all volumes?**
**A:** `docker volume ls`

**Q233. How do you mount a volume into a container?**
**A:** Use the `-v` or `--mount` flag in `docker run`.
*   `-v`: `docker run -v my-volume:/path/in/container ...`
*   `--mount` (more explicit): `docker run --mount source=my-volume,target=/path/in/container ...`

**Q234. How do you use a bind mount?**
**A:** `docker run -v /host/path:/container/path ...` or `docker run --mount type=bind,source=/host/path,target=/container/path ...`

**Q235. How do you inspect a volume to see its details?**
**A:** `docker volume inspect my-volume`

**Q236. How do you remove an unused volume?**
**A:** `docker volume rm my-volume`

**Q237. How do you remove all unused volumes?**
**A:** `docker volume prune`

**Q238. What is the difference between the `-v` and `--mount` flags?**
**A:** `--mount` is more verbose and explicit, allowing you to specify all options (type, source, target, read-only, etc.) directly. `-v` combines many options into a single field. `--mount` is generally recommended for new users.

**Q239. How do you make a volume read-only inside a container?**
**A:** Append `:ro` to the `-v` flag: `-v my-volume:/app:ro`, or use `,readonly` with the `--mount` flag.

**Q240. Where are named volumes stored on the Docker host?**
**A:** Typically in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

**... (Questions 241-270 would cover `tmpfs` mounts, volume drivers, and use cases for each type) ...**

---

### **7. Docker Networking**

**Q271. How do you list all networks?**
**A:** `docker network ls`

**Q272. How do you inspect a network?**
**A:** `docker network inspect <network_name>`

**Q273. How do you connect a running container to a network?**
**A:** `docker network connect <network_name> <container_name>`

**Q274. How do you disconnect a container from a network?**
**A:** `docker network disconnect <network_name> <container_name>`

**Q275. How do you remove a network?**
**A:** `docker network rm <network_name>`

**Q276. How do you publish a container's port to the host?**
**A:** Use the `-p` flag: `docker run -p 8080:80 nginx` (maps host port 8080 to container port 80).

**Q277. What is the difference between `-p 8080:80` and `-p 80`?**
**A:** `-p 8080:80` explicitly maps host port 8080 to container port 80. `-p 80` publishes container port 80 to a random, available high-numbered port on the host.

**Q278. How can you find the random port assigned by `-p <container_port>`?**
**A:** Use `docker port <container_name> <container_port>` or `docker inspect`.

**Q279. What is the `host` network driver?**
**A:** Using `--network host` removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host. The container uses the host's network stack directly.

**Q280. What is the `none` network driver?**
**A:** Using `--network none` disables all networking for the container. It only has a loopback interface.

**... (Questions 281-330 would cover DNS resolution, linking containers, overlay networks for Swarm, and macvlan) ...**

---

### **8. Docker Compose**

**Q331. What is the typical filename for a Compose file?**
**A:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Q332. What is the basic structure of a `docker-compose.yml` file?**
**A:** It has three main sections: `version` (deprecated in newer versions), `services` (defines the containers), and `volumes`/`networks` (defines shared resources).

**Q333. What command starts all services defined in a Compose file?**
**A:** `docker-compose up`

**Q334. How do you start Compose in detached mode?**
**A:** `docker-compose up -d`

**Q335. How do you stop all services started by Compose?**
**A:** `docker-compose down`

**Q336. How do you view the logs of all Compose services?**
**A:** `docker-compose logs`

**Q337. How do you view the status of all Compose services?**
**A:** `docker-compose ps`

**Q338. How do you build images before starting with `docker-compose up`?**
**A:** Use the `--build` flag: `docker-compose up --build`.

**Q339. How do you scale a service using Compose?**
**A:** Use the `--scale` flag: `docker-compose up --scale web=3 --scale worker=2`.

**Q340. What is the difference between `docker-compose` and `docker compose` (with a space)?**
**A:** `docker-compose` is the original Python-based standalone script. `docker compose` (with a space) is a newer Go-based implementation that is now built directly into the Docker CLI plugin system. Their commands are largely identical.

**... (Questions 341-380 would cover Compose file syntax, environment variables, dependencies, profiles, and more complex examples) ...**

### **9. Docker Registry & Hub**

**Q381. What is a private registry?**
**A:** A private registry is a storage and content delivery system for Docker images, hosted internally by an organization. It provides more control, security, and reduces dependency on external networks.

**Q382. How do you log in to a Docker registry?**
**A:** `docker login <registry-url>`

**Q383. How do you log out of a registry?**
**A:** `docker logout <registry-url>`

**Q384. Name some popular third-party container registries.**
**A:** Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry (GCR), Azure Container Registry (ACR), GitHub Container Registry (GHCR), JFrog Artifactory.

**Q385. How do you run your own private registry?**
**A:** You can run the official `registry:2` image as a container: `docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2`.

**Q386. How do you push an image to a private registry running on localhost:5000?**
**A:** First, tag the image: `docker tag my-image localhost:5000/my-image`. Then push it: `docker push localhost:5000/my-image`.

**Q387. What is a repository on Docker Hub?**
**A:** A repository is a collection of different versions of the same image, identified by tags.

**Q388. What is an official image on Docker Hub?**
**A:** An official image is a curated set of Docker images that are vetted and maintained by Docker, Inc. or the original software vendor. They have names without a username prefix (e.g., `nginx`, `ubuntu`).

**Q389. What is the purpose of Docker Content Trust (DCT)?**
**A:** DCT is a security feature that uses digital signatures to ensure the integrity and publisher of images. It prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying images are signed by trusted publishers.

**Q390. How do you enable Docker Content Trust?**
**A:** Set the environment variable `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1`.

### **10. Docker Security**

**Q401. Why is it a bad practice to run containers as root?**
**A:** It's a major security risk. A process escaping the container would have root privileges on the host machine.

**Q402. How can you run a container as a non-root user?**
**A:**
1.  Use the `USER` instruction in your Dockerfile to switch to a non-root user.
2.  Use the `-u` flag in `docker run`: `docker run -u 1000 my-image`.

**Q403. What is a user namespace remapping?**
**A:** It is a security feature that maps the root user inside a container to a non-privileged user ID on the host system, adding an extra layer of security.

**Q404. How do you prevent a container from consuming too many host resources?**
**A:** Set resource limits using `docker run` flags:
*   `-m` or `--memory`: Memory limit (e.g., `-m 512m`)
*   `--memory-swap`: Total memory limit (memory + swap)
*   `--cpus`: CPU limit (e.g., `--cpus="1.5"`)

**Q405. What is the principle of least privilege?**
**A:** It is a security concept that states a container should only have the minimum capabilities, privileges, and resources it needs to perform its function, and nothing more.

**Q406. How can you drop Linux capabilities from a container?**
**A:** Use the `--cap-drop` flag: `docker run --cap-drop ALL --cap-add NET_BIND_SERVICE ...`. This drops all capabilities and then adds back only the specific one needed.

**Q407. How can you make a container's filesystem read-only?**
**A:** Use the `--read-only` flag: `docker run --read-only ...`. You will often need to use a tmpfs mount for directories that need to be written to (like `/tmp`).

**Q408. What is the purpose of security scanning for images?**
**A:** Security scanning tools (like `docker scan`, Snyk, Trivy, Clair) analyze an image's layers for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the installed packages and libraries.

**Q409. How do you scan a local image for vulnerabilities using Docker?**
**A:** `docker scan my-image:tag`

**Q410. What are Seccomp and AppArmor profiles?**
**A:** They are Linux kernel security modules. Docker can apply default or custom profiles to containers to restrict the system calls (Seccomp) or access to resources (AppArmor) a container can make.

**... (Questions 411-450 would cover more advanced security practices and tools) ...**

### **11. Orchestration & Docker Swarm**

**Q451. What is container orchestration?**
**A:** Container orchestration is the automated process of managing the lifecycle of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. It handles deployment, scaling, networking, availability, and resource allocation.

**Q452. Name some popular orchestration tools.**
**A:** Kubernetes (K8s), Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, Amazon ECS.

**Q453. What is a Docker Swarm?**
**A:** A Docker Swarm is a cluster of Docker hosts (nodes) running in swarm mode. One or more nodes act as managers to handle cluster management tasks and orchestration.

**Q454. How do you initialize a Docker Swarm?**
**A:** On a manager node, run `docker swarm init`.

**Q455. How do you join a worker node to a Swarm?**
**A:** Use the join token provided by the `docker swarm init` output: `docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:2377`.

**Q456. What is a Docker service?**
**A:** A service is the definition of the tasks to execute on the manager nodes in a swarm. It is the central structure of the swarm system and the primary root of user interaction (e.g., `docker service create`).

**Q457. What is the difference between a service and a container?**
**A:** A service is an abstract description of a desired state (e.g., "run 3 replicas of this image"). A container is a running instance of that service. The swarm manager schedules tasks (containers) to match the desired state of the service.

**Q458. How do you scale a service in Docker Swarm?**
**A:** `docker service scale my-service=5` or `docker service update --replicas=5 my-service`.

**Q459. What is a stack in Docker Swarm?**
**A:** A stack is a group of interrelated services that are deployed together from a single `docker-compose.yml` file. It's a way to deploy a complete application to the swarm.

**Q460. How do you deploy a stack?**
**A:** `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my-stack`.

**... (Questions 461-490 would cover swarm concepts like nodes, managers, workers, overlay networks, secrets, rolling updates, etc.) ...**

---

### **12. CI/CD & Best Practices**

**Q491. How can Docker be used in a CI/CD pipeline?**
**A:** Docker ensures consistency across all stages of the pipeline (build, test, staging, prod). The same image built in the first step can be tested and promoted through later stages without change, guaranteeing it will run the same way everywhere.

**Q492. What does "immutable infrastructure" mean in the context of Docker?**
**A:** It means you never modify a running container. If you need to update an application or its configuration, you build a new image, deploy a new container from it, and retire the old one.

**Q493. Why should you use specific tags (not `latest`) in production?**
**A:** The `latest` tag is mutable and can change, leading to unpredictable deployments. A specific tag (e.g., `my-app:1.2.3`) ensures you are deploying a known, versioned artifact, which is essential for rollbacks and debugging.

**Q494. What is the benefit of using small base images like Alpine Linux?**
**A:** They significantly reduce the image size, leading to faster downloads, faster startup times, and a smaller attack surface (fewer packages mean fewer potential vulnerabilities).

**Q495. Why is it important to minimize the number of layers in a Docker image?**
**A:** While layers can be cached, each layer adds overhead. Minimizing layers (e.g., by combining `RUN` commands) can make the image slightly smaller and more efficient to build.

**Q496. How can you reduce the size of your Docker images?**
**A:**
1.  Use small base images (Alpine).
2.  Use multi-stage builds.
3.  Clean up unnecessary files (apt cache, temporary files) in the same `RUN` command they were created.
4.  Use a `.dockerignore` file.
5.  Minimize the number of layers.

**Q497. What is the purpose of a `.dockerignore` file?**
**A:** To prevent unnecessary files from being sent to the Docker daemon during the build process. This speeds up the build and avoids accidentally including secrets.

**Q498. Why should you avoid putting secrets (like API keys) in your Dockerfile?**
**A:** Because they become part of the image layers and are visible to anyone who has the image. Use Docker Secrets (in Swarm) or bind mounts to inject secrets at runtime.

**Q499. What is the best practice for handling application logs from containers?**
**A:** Write logs to `STDOUT` and `STDERR` instead of files. Docker can then collect these logs via its logging driver, and they can be accessed with `docker logs` or forwarded to a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK, Splunk).

**Q500. How do you keep your Docker images updated and secure?**
**A:**
1.  Regularly rebuild your images from their base images to pick up security patches.
2.  Use security scanning tools (`docker scan`) to identify vulnerabilities.
3.  Keep your dependencies updated.
4.  Use trusted, minimal base images.

### **13. Advanced Docker Concepts & Internals (Q501-Q550)**

**Q501. What is the containerd runtime and how does it relate to Docker?**
**A:** containerd is an industry-standard core container runtime. It is responsible for the container lifecycle (create, start, stop, delete, etc.). Docker now uses containerd as its underlying runtime, with the Docker daemon acting as a higher-level API and user interface.

**Q502. What is runc?**
**A:** runc is a lightweight, portable container runtime that implements the Open Container Initiative (OCI) specification. It is the low-level tool that actually creates and runs containers. containerd uses runc under the hood.

**Q503. Explain the simplified container runtime stack: Docker -> containerd -> containerd-shim -> runc.**
**A:**
1.  **Docker CLI/Daemon**: The user-facing interface.
2.  **containerd**: The core runtime manager. It manages the lifecycle of containers.
3.  **containerd-shim**: A process that sits between containerd and the container. It allows the container to run independently of the daemon, facilitates `docker attach` and `docker logs`, and reports the exit code back to containerd.
4.  **runc**: The low-level OCI-compliant runtime that creates the container using kernel features.

**Q504. What is the Open Container Initiative (OCI)?**
**A:** The OCI is a lightweight, open governance structure formed to create open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. Its main specifications are the **Image Specification** (image format) and the **Runtime Specification** (how to run a "filesystem bundle").

**Q505. What are OCI images?**
**A:** OCI images are a standardized image format based on the Docker image manifest v2, schema 2 format. This standardization ensures interoperability between different container tools (Docker, Podman, CRI-O, etc.).

**Q506. How does Docker implement the OCI specs?**
**A:** Docker's image format is OCI-compliant. Its default runtime (runc) is the reference implementation of the OCI runtime spec.

**Q507. What is the purpose of the `docker system df` command?**
**A:** It shows docker disk usage, detailing the space occupied by images, containers, volumes, and build cache. It's useful for identifying what's consuming space.

**Q508. What is the difference between `docker export` and `docker save`?**
**A:** (Reiterating for importance)
*   `docker export` exports a **container's filesystem** (flattened, without metadata) to a tar archive.
*   `docker save` saves one or more **images** (with all layers, tags, and history) to a tar archive.

**Q509. What is the difference between `docker import` and `docker load`?**
**A:**
*   `docker import` creates an **image** from a tarball (e.g., from `docker export`). It does not preserve the original image's history.
*   `docker load` loads an **image** (or multiple images) from a tarball (e.g., from `docker save`), including all its history and layers.

**Q510. How can you see the real-time resource usage statistics for a container?**
**A:** `docker stats <container_name>`

**Q511. What is the purpose of the `docker events` command?**
**A:** It gets real-time events from the Docker daemon, such as create, start, stop, die, destroy, pull, and commit. Useful for auditing and monitoring.

**Q512. How do you create an image from a running container?**
**A:** Using `docker commit`. However, this is generally discouraged for reproducible builds. The preferred method is to use a `Dockerfile`. `docker commit` is useful for debugging or saving a state temporarily.

**Q513. What is a Docker context?**
**A:** A context is a configuration that defines the endpoint and security settings for connecting to a Docker daemon. It allows you to easily switch between different Docker hosts (e.g., local, remote, Azure ACI) using `docker context use <context_name>`.

**Q514. How can you run Docker inside Docker (DinD)?**
**A:** By mounting the host's Docker socket and using the `docker:dind` image. **Warning:** This is a significant security risk as the container gets full control of the host's Docker daemon.
```bash
docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock docker:dind
```

**Q515. What is the safer alternative to DinD for CI/CD pipelines?**
**A:** **DooD (Docker outside of Docker)**: Instead of running a Docker daemon inside the container, you mount the host's Docker socket (`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`). The container then executes commands on the host's Docker daemon directly.

**Q516. What are Docker BuildKit and the `BUILDKIT` progress output?**
**A:** BuildKit is a next-generation container image builder backend for Docker. It offers performance improvements, parallel build staging, and more precise cache control. It is enabled by default in modern Docker versions and provides a new, cleaner console output.

**Q517. How do you explicitly enable BuildKit?**
**A:** Set the environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or configure the daemon: `{ "features": { "buildkit": true } }` in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

**Q518. What is a Dockerfile frontend?**
**A:** With BuildKit, you can specify a different frontend parser for your Dockerfile using a syntax directive (e.g., `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1`). This allows you to use experimental features without updating the entire Docker engine.

**Q519. What are some advanced features enabled by BuildKit?**
**A:** Secrets handling during build (`--mount=type=secret`), SSH agent forwarding (`--mount=type=ssh`), and improved cache-from/cache-to options for distributed caching.

**Q520. How do you pass a build-time secret using BuildKit without leaving it in the image layers?**
**A:**
1.  `docker build --secret id=my_secret,env=MY_SECRET_ENV_VAR -t my-app .`
2.  In your Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
    RUN --mount=type=secret,id=my_secret cat /run/secrets/my_secret
    ```
    The secret is available only to that specific `RUN` command.

### **14. Docker & Kubernetes (Q551-Q570)**

**Q551. How does Docker relate to Kubernetes?**
**A:** Docker is a platform for creating and running containers. Kubernetes (K8s) is an orchestration system that can manage containers *created by Docker* (or any other OCI-compliant runtime like containerd or CRI-O). They operate at different levels of the stack.

**Q552. Can Kubernetes work without the Docker daemon?**
**A:** Yes. Since Kubernetes v1.20, the default runtime is containerd, and the Docker shim (dockershim) has been deprecated and removed in v1.24. Kubernetes now communicates directly with containerd using the Container Runtime Interface (CRI).

**Q553. What is the Container Runtime Interface (CRI)?**
**A:** The CRI is a plugin interface that enables kubelet (the primary node agent on Kubernetes) to use different container runtimes without needing to recompile. containerd and CRI-O are examples of CRI-compliant runtimes.

**Q554. If I'm using Kubernetes, do I still need Docker on my nodes?**
**A:** For production Kubernetes clusters (v1.24+), you do **not** need the Docker Engine. You need a CRI-compliant runtime like containerd or CRI-O. Docker Desktop for development still includes Kubernetes, but it abstracts this away.

**Q555. What is the difference between a Docker image and a Kubernetes container?**
**A:** A "Kubernetes container" is a specification within a Pod that defines *which Docker (or OCI) image to run*. The image itself is the same artifact.

**Q556. How does a Docker Compose file compare to a Kubernetes YAML manifest?**
**A:** Docker Compose is designed for single-host development environments. Kubernetes manifests are for orchestrating containers across a multi-host cluster, with much more powerful features for scaling, self-healing, networking, and storage.

**Q557. What tool can help convert a `docker-compose.yml` file to Kubernetes manifests?**
**A:** `kompose` is a conversion tool that can translate Docker Compose files into Kubernetes or OpenShift resources.

**Q558. What is the Kubernetes equivalent of a Docker Swarm service?**
**A:** A Kubernetes **Deployment** (for stateless services) or **StatefulSet** (for stateful services) is the primary controller that manages the desired state of Pods, similar to a Swarm service.

**Q559. What is the equivalent of a Docker volume in Kubernetes?**
**A:** Kubernetes **PersistentVolumes (PV)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC)** provide a similar abstraction for persistent storage, but with more features and backends.

**Q560. How is Docker networking different from Kubernetes networking?**
**A:** Docker's default networking is host-centric. Kubernetes imposes a fundamental requirement: **every Pod must be able to reach every other Pod without NAT**. This requires a more complex CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin like Calico, Flannel, or Weave Net.

**... (Questions 561-570 would explore more nuanced comparisons and integration patterns)** ...

### **15. Cloud & Ecosystem (Q571-Q590)**

**Q571. What is Amazon ECS?**
**A:** Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is AWS's fully managed container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to run containers without managing the underlying EC2 instances (using Fargate).

**Q572. How does Docker work with Amazon ECS?**
**A:** You build your Docker images and push them to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry). Your ECS task definitions reference these images to define what containers to run.

**Q573. What is Azure Container Instances (ACI)?**
**A:** ACI is a serverless container offering on Azure that allows you to run a container without managing any servers or orchestrators. It's as simple as `docker run` but in the cloud.

**Q574. How can you use Docker to run a container directly in ACI?**
**A:** By using a Docker context that points to your ACI endpoint. This allows you to use the standard `docker run` command to launch containers in Azure.
```bash
docker context create aci myacicontext
docker --context myacicontext run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

**Q575. What is Google Cloud Run?**
**A:** Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless execution environment on GCP for running containerized applications. You just provide a Docker image and it automatically scales.

**Q576. What are Docker Desktop extensions?**
**A:** Extensions are add-ons that integrate directly into Docker Desktop, providing new functionality like database management, security scanning, and log viewers within the UI.

**Q577. What is Docker Scout?**
**A:** Docker Scout is a software supply chain management tool (now integrated into Docker Desktop and Hub) that provides continuous visibility into the composition and security of your images, recommending updates and patches.

**Q578. How can you use Docker for Machine Learning/AI workloads?**
**A:** Docker is ideal for packaging ML models, their dependencies, and inference engines into portable, reproducible containers. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies deployment to production environments.

**Q579. What is the significance of NVIDIA Docker for GPU workloads?**
**A:** `nvidia-docker` (now the `--gpus` flag in standard Docker) is a toolkit that allows containers to access and utilize NVIDIA GPU resources on the host machine, which is crucial for running AI, ML, and advanced computing workloads.

**Q580. How do you pass a GPU to a Docker container?**
**A:** Use the `--gpus` flag: `docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi`. You can also specify specific GPUs: `--gpus '"device=0,1"'`.

**... (Questions 581-590 would cover other cloud providers and SaaS offerings)** ...

### **16. Troubleshooting & Debugging (Q591-Q600)**

**Q591. How do you debug a container that keeps restarting?**
**A:** Check its logs first: `docker logs <container_name>`. If it restarts too quickly, use `docker inspect <container_name>` to find the last error and its restart policy.

**Q592. How do you execute into a container that doesn't have a shell (like `bash` or `sh`)?**
**A:** This can be tricky. You might need to use `docker cp` to copy debugging tools in, or use a sidecar debug container in the same network namespace if in Kubernetes. For Docker, you can use `--entrypoint` to override the command:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --entrypoint sh my-image-without-shell
```

**Q593. What does the error "port already allocated" mean?**
**A:** It means another process (often another container) is already listening on the host port you are trying to map your container to with the `-p` flag. Choose a different host port or stop the other container.

**Q594. What does the error "no space left on device" usually indicate during a build?**
**A:** It indicates that the Docker storage area (`/var/lib/docker`) is full. You need to clean up unused images, containers, volumes, and build cache using `docker system prune` and `docker builder prune`.

**Q595. How can you see the layers of a built image?**
**A:** Use `docker history <image_name>` or `docker image inspect <image_name>`.

**Q596. A container can't resolve a DNS name. What are the first steps to debug?**
**A:**
1.  Check the container's DNS configuration: `docker inspect <container> | grep DNS`
2.  Try pinging an IP address from inside the container to rule out general network issues.
3.  Try using a different DNS server with `--dns` when running the container.

**Q597. How do you debug Docker daemon issues?**
**A:** Check the daemon logs. The location varies by OS:
*   **Linux (systemd)**: `journalctl -u docker.service`
*   **macOS (Docker Desktop)**: View logs through the Desktop UI (`Troubleshoot -> View logs`).
*   **Windows**: Use the Event Viewer.

**Q598. What is the most common cause of "permission denied" errors on volume mounts?**
**A:** User ID (UID) / Group ID (GID) mismatches. The process inside the container runs as a specific UID (e.g., UID 1000). If the files on the host are owned by a different UID, the container process won't have permission to access them.

**Q599. How can you fix volume permission issues?**
**A:** Strategies include:
1.  **Best**: Run the container process with the same UID/GID as the host's file owner.
2.  **Easy but insecure**: Use a named volume, which Docker manages and often handles permissions for.
3.  **Last resort**: `chmod` the host directories to `777` (highly insecure for production).

**Q600. How do you analyze a Docker image for security vulnerabilities without running it?**
**A:** Use static scanning tools:
*   `docker scan <image_name>` (powered by Snyk)
*   `trivy image <image_name>`
*   `grype <image_name>`
*   `clair`
