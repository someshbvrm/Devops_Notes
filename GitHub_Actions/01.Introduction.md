# üìå GitHub Actions: CI/CD Platform Overview

GitHub Actions is a **continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)** platform built directly into GitHub.
It allows you to **automate, build, test, and deploy** your software directly from your repository.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components of GitHub Actions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Workflows**

* A workflow is a **configurable automated process** consisting of one or more jobs.
* Defined in the repository under:
  `.github/workflows/`
* Written using **YAML syntax**.
* Workflows can run on events like:

  * `push`
  * `pull_request`
  * `schedule` (cron jobs)
  * `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger)
  * `release`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Jobs**

* A job is a **group of steps** executed on the same runner.
* Jobs can run:

  * **Sequentially** (default)
  * **In parallel** (using `needs` keyword)
* Jobs are isolated; outputs can be passed between jobs using **artifacts** or **outputs**.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Steps**

* Steps are individual tasks inside a job.
* Can be:

  * A **shell command** (`run`)
  * A **prebuilt or custom action** (`uses`)
* Steps are executed **in order**, and later steps can depend on previous steps.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Events**

* Events **trigger workflows** when specific activities occur.
* Examples:

  * `push` ‚Üí workflow runs on commit
  * `pull_request` ‚Üí workflow runs on PR creation
  * `issue_comment` ‚Üí workflow runs when a comment is added
  * `schedule` ‚Üí workflow runs on a cron schedule
* Each event can be **filtered by branches or tags**.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Actions**

* Actions are **reusable building blocks** for your workflow.
* Can be:

  * Prebuilt (from GitHub Marketplace)
  * Custom-defined in your repository
* Helps to **avoid repeating code** and simplify workflow YAML.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Runners**

* Runners are **machines that execute jobs**.
* Types:

  * **GitHub-hosted runners** (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
  * **Self-hosted runners** (your own servers or VMs)
* Each runner executes **one job at a time**.
* Runners can have **labels** to target specific jobs.

## üìù Workflow Example: Simple CI

```yaml
name: My Awesome Workflow  # Workflow name

on:
  push:  # Trigger on push events
    branches:
      - main
      - develop

jobs:
  build:  # Job name
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # GitHub-hosted runner

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Checkout repo code

      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 17

      - name: Build Project
        run: mvn clean package

      - name: Run Tests
        run: mvn test

      - name: Say Hello
        run: echo "üëã Hello, world! GitHub Actions workflow executed successfully!"
```

## üîπ Advanced Features

1. **Environment Variables**

   * Set globally for the workflow:

     ```yaml
     env:
       JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
     ```
   * Or per job/step.

2. **Secrets**

   * Secure variables like API keys or tokens.
   * Access in workflow:

     ```yaml
     with:
       token: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
     ```

3. **Artifacts**

   * Store and share files between jobs or for download:

     ```yaml
     - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
       with:
         name: my-artifact
         path: target/*.jar
     ```

4. **Matrices**

   * Run jobs across multiple environments or versions:

     ```yaml
     strategy:
       matrix:
         java: [17, 21]
         os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
     ```

5. **Notifications**

   * Can send workflow status notifications to Slack, Teams, or email using actions.

6. **Workflow Visualization**

   * GitHub provides a **graphical view** of jobs and steps for debugging.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Use **separate workflows** for CI and CD.
* Use **actions from trusted sources**.
* Minimize secrets exposure in logs.
* Reuse **actions and templates** for standardization.
* Always **pin versions** of actions (`@v3`) for stability.
