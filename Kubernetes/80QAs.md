### **1. Kubernetes Fundamentals & Core Concepts**

**Q1. What is Kubernetes?**
**A:** Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

**Q2. What are the main benefits of using Kubernetes?**
**A:**
*   **Service discovery and load balancing**
*   **Storage orchestration**
*   **Automated rollouts and rollbacks**
*   **Automatic bin packing** (placing containers based on resource needs)
*   **Self-healing** (restarts, replaces, kills containers that fail)
*   **Secret and configuration management**
*   **Horizontal scaling**

**Q3. What is the difference between Kubernetes and Docker?**
**A:** **Docker** is a platform for building, shipping, and running individual containers. **Kubernetes** is a system for orchestrating and managing multiple containers across multiple hosts. Docker can run containers, while Kubernetes manages containers created by Docker or other container runtimes (like containerd, CRI-O).

**Q4. What is a Container Orchestration Engine?**
**A:** A Container Orchestration Engine automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. It helps manage the lifecycle of containerized applications across a cluster of machines. Kubernetes is the most popular example.

**Q5. What is a Pod?**
**A:** A Pod is the smallest and simplest Kubernetes object. It is a logical group of one or more containers that share storage/network and a specification for how to run the containers. Containers in a Pod are always co-located and co-scheduled.

**Q6. What is a Node?**
**A:** A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes, which can be a virtual or physical machine. Each Node is managed by the control plane and contains the services necessary to run Pods, such as the container runtime, kubelet, and kube-proxy.

**Q7. What is a Cluster?**
**A:** A cluster is a set of Nodes (worker machines) that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node and a control plane to manage the nodes and pods.

**Q8. What is the Control Plane?**
**A:** The control plane is the container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers. Its components (API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, etcd) make global decisions about the cluster.

**Q9. What is etcd?**
**A:** etcd is a consistent and highly-available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data. It stores the desired state and the current state of the cluster.

**Q10. What is the desired state vs. the current state?**
**A:** The **desired state** is how you want your application to run: which images to use, how many replicas, which network and disk resources to use, etc. The **current state** is the actual running state of the cluster. Kubernetes constantly works to make the current state match the desired state.

---

### **2. Cluster Architecture & Components**

**Q11. What are the main components of the Kubernetes Control Plane?**
**A:**
*   **kube-apiserver:** The front-end for the Kubernetes control plane; validates and configures data for API objects.
*   **etcd:** Consistent and highly-available key-value store for all cluster data.
*   **kube-scheduler:** Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.
*   **kube-controller-manager:** Runs controller processes (Node Controller, Replication Controller, Endpoints Controller, etc.).
*   **cloud-controller-manager:** Embeds cloud-specific control logic (Node controller, Route controller, Service controller).

**Q12. What are the main components of a Worker Node?**
**A:**
*   **kubelet:** An agent that runs on each node; ensures containers are running in a Pod.
*   **kube-proxy:** Maintains network rules on nodes, enabling communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside your cluster.
*   **Container Runtime:** The software responsible for running containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker Engine).

**Q13. What is the role of the kube-apiserver?**
**A:** It is the central management entity and the only component that communicates with the etcd datastore. It validates and processes REST requests, updating etcd and then triggering other components to get into the desired state.

**Q14. What is the role of the kube-scheduler?**
**A:** It is responsible for assigning Pods to Nodes. It watches for unscheduled Pods and chooses the best Node to run them on based on resource requirements, hardware constraints, affinity/anti-affinity specifications, etc.

**Q15. What is the role of the kube-controller-manager?**
**A:** It runs controllers that handle routine tasks in the cluster. For example:
*   **Node Controller:** Monitors node status.
*   **Replication Controller:** Maintains the correct number of Pods.
*   **Endpoints Controller:** Populates Endpoints objects (joins Services & Pods).
*   **Service Account & Token Controllers:** Create default accounts and API access tokens for namespaces.

**Q16. What is the role of the kubelet?**
**A:** It is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. It takes a set of PodSpecs (from the API server) and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy.

**Q17. What is the role of kube-proxy?**
**A:** It maintains network rules on the node. It enables the Kubernetes service abstraction by performing connection forwarding or load balancing for services to the correct Pods.

**Q18. What is a Container Runtime Interface (CRI)?**
**A:** CRI is a plugin interface that enables kubelet to use a variety of container runtimes without needing to recompile. Examples of CRI runtimes are containerd, CRI-O, and Docker (via a shim).

**Q19. What is the difference between a Master Node and a Worker Node?**
**A:** **Master Nodes** host the control plane components (API Server, Scheduler, etcd, Controller Manager) that manage the cluster. **Worker Nodes** host the kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime to run the application workloads (Pods).

**Q20. How do the control plane components achieve high availability?**
**A:** By running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
*   **API Server:** Multiple instances are stateless and can be load-balanced.
*   **etcd:** Forms a distributed, highly available cluster.
*   **Scheduler & Controller Manager:** Only one instance of each is active at a time (leader election), with others on standby.

### **3. Pods**

**Q21. What is a Pod? Why is it the atomic unit in Kubernetes?**
**A:** A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in the cluster. It's "atomic" because Kubernetes manages Pods, not individual containers. A Pod encapsulates one or more containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run.

**Q22. Why would you run multiple containers in a single Pod?**
**A:** To co-locate and co-manage helper processes that are tightly coupled to a primary application. A classic example is a web server container and a log watcher/sidecar container that rotates the server's logs.

**Q23. What is the "Pause" container?**
**A:** Every Pod has a hidden, infrastructure container called the "pause" container. Its purpose is to hold and manage the network namespace (IP address) and other kernel namespaces (PID, etc.) for all the other containers in the Pod. This allows containers within a Pod to share resources.

**Q24. How do containers within a Pod communicate?**
**A:** They can communicate via `localhost` and standard inter-process communications (e.g., signals, shared memory) since they share the same network namespace and can see each other's processes.

**Q25. What is a Pod template?**
**A:** A Pod template is a specification for creating Pods, embedded in higher-level objects like Deployments, Jobs, or DaemonSets. Controllers use the Pod template to create actual Pods.

**Q26. What is a Static Pod?**
**A:** A Static Pod is managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. They are defined by placing a Pod manifest file in a specific directory (e.g., `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`). The kubelet automatically creates them. This is often how control plane components (like `kube-apiserver`) are run.

**Q27. What is the Pod's lifecycle?**
**A:**
1.  **Pending:** The Pod has been accepted, but one or more containers have not been set up and run.
2.  **Running:** The Pod is bound to a node, and all containers have been created. At least one container is running, is in the process of starting, or is restarting.
3.  **Succeeded:** All containers have terminated successfully and will not be restarted.
4.  **Failed:** All containers have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure.
5.  **Unknown:** The Pod state could not be obtained, often due to a communication error with the node.

**Q28. What are Pod Presets? (Deprecated)**
**A:** Pod Presets were a way to inject information like secrets, volume mounts, and environment variables into Pods at creation time. This feature was deprecated in favor of more flexible solutions like Admission Webhooks.

**Q29. How do you create a Pod?**
**A:** By defining a Pod manifest in YAML or JSON and applying it with `kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:1.19
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

**Q30. What are Init Containers?**
**A:** Init containers are specialized containers that run before the app containers in a Pod. They can contain setup scripts not present in the app image. They always run to completion, and each must succeed before the next one starts. They are useful for delaying app startup until preconditions are met (e.g., a database is ready).

---

### **4. Controllers & Workloads**

**Q31. What is a Controller?**
**A:** A controller is a control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the API server and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state. Examples: ReplicaSet, Deployment, StatefulSet controllers.

**Q32. What is a ReplicaSet?**
**A:** A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. It ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are always running. It is often used by higher-level controllers like Deployments.

**Q33. What is a Deployment?**
**A:** A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. It enables rolling updates, rollbacks, and is the most common way to manage stateless applications.

**Q34. What is the difference between a ReplicaSet and a Deployment?**
**A:** A **Deployment** manages a ReplicaSet and provides declarative updates and rollback functionality. A **ReplicaSet** simply ensures the desired number of Pod replicas are running. You typically use a Deployment, which then creates and manages the ReplicaSet for you.

**Q35. How does a rolling update work in a Deployment?**
**A:** When you update the Pod template (e.g., a new image), the Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet and scales it up while scaling down the old ReplicaSet, one Pod at a time. This ensures zero-downtime deployment if your application supports multiple replicas.

**Q36. How do you roll back a Deployment?**
**A:** Use the `kubectl rollout undo` command.
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment
# You can also specify a specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-deployment --to-revision=2
```

**Q37. What is a DaemonSet?**
**A:** A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed, those Pods are garbage collected. Typical use cases: logging agents (fluentd), monitoring agents (node-exporter), or network plugins (kube-proxy itself).

**Q38. What is a StatefulSet?**
**A:** A StatefulSet is a workload API object used to manage stateful applications. It provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods. Each Pod has a persistent identifier that is maintained across any rescheduling.
*   **Stable, unique network identifiers.**
*   **Stable, persistent storage.**
*   **Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.**
*   **Ordered, automated rolling updates.**
Use cases: databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch.

**Q39. What is a Headless Service? When is it used?**
**A:** A Headless Service is a service with no cluster IP (`clusterIP: None`). It allows you to directly connect to the Pods, bypassing the kube-proxy load balancing. It is used by StatefulSets to allow each Pod to have a stable DNS record for direct access (e.g., `pod-0.my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local`).

**Q40. What is a Job?**
**A:** A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate. As Pods complete successfully, the Job tracks the successful completions. Use cases: batch processing, running a task to completion.

**Q41. What is a CronJob?**
**A:** A CronJob creates Jobs on a repeating schedule, written in Cron format. Use cases: periodic backups, report generation, sending emails.

**Q42. What is the difference between a `Recreate` and `RollingUpdate` deployment strategy?**
**A:**
*   **Recreate:** All existing Pods are killed before new ones are created. This strategy causes downtime.
*   **RollingUpdate:** The old Pods are gradually replaced with new ones. This is the default and allows for zero-downtime deployments.

**Q43. How can you control the rollout strategy of a Deployment?**
**A:** Using the `strategy` field in the Deployment spec.
```yaml
spec:
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
```

**Q44. What do `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` mean?**
**A:** These are parameters for the `RollingUpdate` strategy.
*   **`maxSurge`:** The maximum number of Pods that can be created *over* the desired number of Pods during the update. It can be a number or a percentage (e.g., `25%`).
*   **`maxUnavailable`:** The maximum number of Pods that can be unavailable during the update. It can be a number or a percentage.

**Q45. How does a StatefulSet ensure ordered Pod management?**
**A:** Pods in a StatefulSet are created sequentially, from ordinal 0 to N-1. The next Pod is not created until the previous one is Running and Ready. During deletion, they are terminated in reverse order, from ordinal N-1 to 0.

**Q46. What is a Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)?**
**A:** A PDB limits the number of Pods of a replicated application that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions (e.g., node drain, cluster upgrade). It ensures high availability during maintenance operations.
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: my-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2 # OR maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
```

### **5. Services & Networking**

**Q47. What is a Service in Kubernetes?**
**A:** A Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. It provides a stable IP address, DNS name, and load balancing for the Pods, which are ephemeral and can change.

**Q48. Why do we need a Service?**
**A:** Because Pods are ephemeral—they can be created, destroyed, and rescheduled dynamically. Their IP addresses change. A Service provides a stable endpoint (virtual IP) to communicate with the dynamic set of Pods that form a microservice.

**Q49. What are the types of Services?**
**A:**
*   **ClusterIP:** Default type. Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Only reachable from within the cluster.
*   **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
*   **LoadBalancer:** Creates an external load balancer in the cloud provider (e.g., an ELB in AWS) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. The most straightforward way to expose a service externally.
*   **ExternalName:** Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g., `my.database.example.com`), by returning a CNAME record.

**Q50. What is a ClusterIP?**
**A:** It is a virtual IP address that is only reachable from within the cluster. It is the default and most common Service type, used for internal communication between microservices.

**Q51. How does kube-proxy work?**
**A:** kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node. It maintains network rules that allow network communication to your Pods. It can operate in different modes:
*   **iptables mode (default):** Uses Linux iptables rules to redirect traffic to Pods randomly.
*   **IPVS mode:** Uses the Linux kernel's IP Virtual Server for more efficient load balancing (better performance for large clusters).
*   **userspace mode (legacy):** Proxy running in userspace.

**Q52. What are Endpoints and EndpointSlices?**
**A:** An **Endpoints** object is a list of IP addresses and ports that make up a Service. It is automatically created to point to the Pods matching the Service's selector. **EndpointSlices** are a newer, more scalable alternative to Endpoints, breaking the large list of endpoints into multiple smaller slices.

**Q53. What is the difference between a Service and an Ingress?**
**A:** A **Service** provides internal load balancing and a stable network endpoint for a set of Pods. An **Ingress** is an API object that manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP/HTTPS. It provides features like SSL termination, name-based virtual hosting, and path-based routing. An Ingress *requires* an Ingress Controller to function.

**Q54. What is an Ingress Controller?**
**A:** An Ingress Controller is a daemon that runs in a cluster and evaluates Ingress resources to configure a load balancer or reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Traefik, HAProxy, AWS ALB Ingress Controller) according to the rules defined in the Ingress.

**Q55. How do you expose a Service to the outside world?**
**A:** Primarily through:
1.  **Service type: LoadBalancer**
2.  **Service type: NodePort** (and then accessing a node's IP)
3.  **Using an Ingress resource** (for HTTP/HTTPS traffic)

**Q56. What is the Kubernetes DNS service?**
**A:** CoreDNS (replacing kube-dns) is typically the DNS server running as a system service in the cluster. It creates DNS records for Services and Pods, allowing you to address services by name instead of IP address.

**Q57. How do you resolve a Service name from within the cluster?**
**A:** The DNS name for a Service is: `<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`. The `cluster.local` part is the default cluster domain. From within the same namespace, you can just use `<service-name>`.

**Q58. What is a NetworkPolicy?**
**A:** A NetworkPolicy is a specification of how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints. It acts as a firewall for Pods, controlling ingress and egress traffic. It requires a CNI plugin that supports NetworkPolicy (e.g., Calico, Cilium, Weave Net).

**Q59. How does Kubernetes assign IP addresses to Pods?**
**A:** Each node has a CIDR block of IPs for Pods. When a Pod is scheduled on a node, the kubelet (via the container runtime) assigns a free IP from the node's Pod CIDR to the Pod. The entire process is managed by the cluster's CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin.

**Q60. What is CNI?**
**A:** The Container Network Interface (CNI) is a plugin specification that defines how network connectivity should be provided to containers. Kubernetes uses CNI plugins (like Calico, Flannel, Weave Net) to set up the pod network.

### **6. Storage & Volumes**

**Q61. How does storage work in Kubernetes? Why can't we just use the container's filesystem?**
**A:** A container's filesystem is ephemeral—it disappears when the container restarts or moves. For persistent data, you must use a Kubernetes **Volume**, which has an explicit lifetime independent of any Pod. It outlives the containers and persists across container restarts.

**Q62. What is a Volume?**
**A:** A Volume is a directory, possibly with some data in it, which is accessible to the containers in a Pod. It exists as long as the Pod exists. If a Pod is restarted, the Volume remains.

**Q63. What is a PersistentVolume (PV)?**
**A:** A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. It is a cluster resource, just like a node. Examples: a piece of NFS storage, a GCE Persistent Disk, an AWS EBS volume.

**Q64. What is a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?**
**A:** A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources, while PVCs consume PV resources. A PVC requests specific size and access modes (e.g., ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany) from a PV.

**Q65. What is the relationship between a Pod, a PVC, and a PV?**
**A:** A Pod uses a PVC as a volume. The PVC binds to a PV that satisfies the claim. The underlying storage infrastructure (like an EBS volume) is represented by the PV.
**Pod -> PVC -> PV -> Actual Storage (e.g., EBS Volume)**

**Q66. What are Access Modes for Volumes?**
**A:** They define how a PV can be mounted:
*   **ReadWriteOnce (RWO):** Can be mounted as read-write by a single node.
*   **ReadOnlyMany (ROX):** Can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.
*   **ReadWriteMany (RWX):** Can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.
*   **ReadWriteOncePod (RWOP):** (K8s v1.22+) Can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod.

**Q67. What is a StorageClass?**
**A:** A StorageClass allows administrators to define different "classes" of storage (e.g., fast SSD, slow HDD). It is used to enable dynamic volume provisioning. When a PVC requests a StorageClass, the cluster automatically provisions a PV that matches.

**Q68. What is Dynamic Provisioning?**
**A:** Dynamic provisioning allows storage volumes to be created on-demand automatically. Without it, an admin has to manually create the underlying storage and then the PV object. With a StorageClass, the PVC can trigger the automatic creation of the storage and the PV.

**Q69. What is the difference between `emptyDir` and `hostPath` volumes?**
**A:**
*   **`emptyDir`:** A temporary directory created when a Pod is assigned to a node. It exists only for the lifetime of that Pod and is erased when the Pod is removed. It is stored on the node's medium (disk or RAM).
*   **`hostPath`:** Mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into the Pod. It is not portable and can be a security risk. Used for system-level pods that need access to the host (e.g., monitoring agents needing `/sys`).

**Q70. What is a CSI driver?**
**A:** The Container Storage Interface (CSI) is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads. A CSI driver is a plugin that enables Kubernetes to use a specific storage system (e.g., AWS EBS, GCP PD, Azure Disk, NetApp, Ceph).

---

### **7. Configuration & Secrets**

**Q71. What are the ways to configure a application in Kubernetes?**
**A:**
1.  **Command-line arguments** to the container: `args` in the container spec.
2.  **Environment variables:** `env` or `envFrom` in the container spec.
3.  **Configuration files mounted into the container:** Using **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** as volumes.

**Q72. What is a ConfigMap?**
**A:** A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume. It decouples environment-specific configuration from container images.

**Q73. What is a Secret?**
**A:** A Secret is an API object for storing sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, or SSH keys. It is similar to a ConfigMap but is intended to hold confidential data. Kubernetes and systems in the cluster offer additional protections for Secrets.

**Q74. How are Secrets different from ConfigMaps?**
**A:**
*   **Intent:** Secrets are for sensitive data; ConfigMaps are for non-sensitive data.
*   **Encoding:** Secret data is stored as base64-encoded strings, while ConfigMap data can be UTF-8 strings or binary data (base64 for binary).
*   **Protections:** Kubernetes might offer additional protections for Secrets at rest (encryption) and finer-grained access control, though by default, they are only base64-encoded and not encrypted.

**Q75. Are Secrets secure by default?**
**A:** **No.** By default, Secrets are stored in etcd as base64-encoded strings, which is not encryption (it's easily reversible). For true security, you must enable **Encryption at Rest** for Secrets, which encrypts them within etcd.

**Q76. How do you create a ConfigMap from a file?**
**A:**
```bash
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=path/to/file.properties
# or from a literal value
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=key=value
```

**Q77. How do you use a ConfigMap in a Pod?**
**A:** As an environment variable:
```yaml
env:
- name: SPECIAL_LEVEL_KEY
  valueFrom:
    configMapKeyRef:
      name: my-config
      key: special.level
```
Or as a volume:
```yaml
volumes:
- name: config-volume
  configMap:
    name: my-config
```

**Q78. How do you update a ConfigMap or Secret that is being used by a running Pod?**
**A:** The update is not automatic for environment variables. Pods must be restarted to pick up new values from a ConfigMap/Secret used in `env`. For ConfigMaps/Secrets mounted as **volumes**, the update is eventually propagated to the Pod, but the timing depends on the kubelet's sync period.

**Q79. What is the `envFrom` field used for?**
**A:** It allows you to import all key-value pairs from a ConfigMap or Secret as environment variables into a container.
```yaml
envFrom:
- configMapRef:
    name: my-configmap
- secretRef:
    name: my-secret
```

**Q80. What is a `downwardAPI` volume?**
**A:** It is a special volume that makes Pod and container field data available to the application running in the container. For example, you can expose the Pod's name, namespace, or a container's CPU limit as a file inside the container.
```yaml
volumes:
- name: podinfo
  downwardAPI:
    items:
    - path: "labels"
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: metadata.labels
```
