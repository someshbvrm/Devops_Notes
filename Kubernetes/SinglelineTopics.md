## ðŸ”¹ Core Components

* **API Server** â€“ Central control plane, handles all kubectl/REST requests.
* **etcd** â€“ Stores cluster state, configs, and secrets in a distributed key-value database.
* **Controller Manager** â€“ Runs controllers like Node, Replication, and Endpoint controllers.
* **Scheduler** â€“ Decides which node each pod runs on, based on resources and constraints.
* **Kubelet** â€“ Node agent that ensures containers are running and healthy.
* **Kube Proxy** â€“ Handles cluster networking and load balances traffic between pods.
* **Pod** â€“ Smallest deployable unit containing one or more containers.
* **Node** â€“ Worker machine (VM/physical) that runs pods.
* **Cluster** â€“ Group of nodes controlled by a single Kubernetes control plane.
* **Namespace** â€“ Logical separation for isolating workloads and resources.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Add-on Components

* **CoreDNS** â€“ Internal DNS for pod-to-pod and service discovery.
* **Dashboard** â€“ Web-based UI to monitor and manage cluster resources.
* **Ingress Controller** â€“ Manages HTTP/HTTPS access to services.
* **Metrics Server** â€“ Collects pod and node resource metrics for autoscaling.
* **Helm** â€“ Package manager for Kubernetes using charts.
* **CNI Plugins** â€“ Provide pod networking across nodes (Calico, Flannel, Cilium).
* **Logging & Monitoring Tools** â€“ Add-ons like Prometheus, Grafana, EFK/ELK.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Probes (Pod Health Checks)

* **Liveness Probe** â€“ Restarts containers if they become unresponsive.
* **Readiness Probe** â€“ Ensures a pod only receives traffic when ready.
* **Startup Probe** â€“ Checks if the container has successfully started.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Affinity & Anti-Affinity Rules

* **Node Affinity** â€“ Schedules pods onto specific nodes based on labels.
* **Pod Affinity** â€“ Co-locates pods on the same node for better performance.
* **Node Anti-Affinity** - 
* **Pod Anti-Affinity** â€“ Spreads pods across nodes for high availability.
* **Taints and Tolerations** â€“ Prevent or allow pods to be scheduled on certain nodes.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Workload Controllers

* **Deployment** â€“ Manages stateless apps with scaling and updates.
* **ReplicaSet** â€“ Ensures a defined number of pod replicas are running.
* **StatefulSet** â€“ Manages stateful apps with stable network IDs and storage.
* **DaemonSet** â€“ Runs one pod copy per node (e.g., logging/monitoring agents).
* **Job** â€“ Runs a task to completion.
* **CronJob** â€“ Runs jobs on a schedule (like cron in Linux).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Services & Networking

* **ClusterIP** â€“ Internal-only service.
* **NodePort** â€“ Exposes service on each nodeâ€™s IP.
* **LoadBalancer** â€“ Exposes service externally with cloud load balancer.
* **ExternalName** â€“ Maps service to external DNS name.
* **Ingress** â€“ Defines HTTP/HTTPS routing rules.
* **Network Policies** â€“ Control which pods/services can talk to each other.
* **Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)** â€“ Advanced traffic control, security, observability.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Storage & Data

* **Persistent Volume (PV)** â€“ Actual storage in the cluster (e.g., EBS, NFS).
* **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** â€“ A request for storage by a pod.
* **StorageClass** â€“ Defines types of storage (fast, slow, SSD, HDD).
* **ConfigMap** â€“ Stores non-secret config data for pods.
* **Secret** â€“ Stores sensitive data like passwords, tokens, and keys.
* **CSI (Container Storage Interface)** â€“ Standard for connecting external storage systems.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security & Access Control

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** â€“ Grants permissions to users, groups, and service accounts.
* **Service Account** â€“ Provides identity for pods to interact with the API server.
* **Network Policies** â€“ Restrict communication between pods/namespaces.
* **Pod Security Standards (PSS)** â€“ Define pod-level security policies.
* **Admission Controllers** â€“ Intercept requests to enforce policies.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scaling & Reliability

* **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** â€“ Scales pods based on CPU/memory usage.
* **Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)** â€“ Adjusts pod resource requests/limits automatically.
* **Cluster Autoscaler** â€“ Adjusts the number of nodes in the cluster.
* **Resource Quotas** â€“ Limits CPU/memory usage per namespace/project.
* **LimitRange** â€“ Sets default or max/min resource limits per pod/container.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Observability

* **Events** â€“ Record of whatâ€™s happening inside the cluster.
* **Logs** â€“ Application and system logs from pods/nodes.
* **Metrics** â€“ Performance data collected by Metrics Server, Prometheus, etc.
* **Tracing** â€“ Distributed tracing with Jaeger or Zipkin.
