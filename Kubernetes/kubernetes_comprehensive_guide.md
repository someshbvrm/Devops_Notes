# Kubernetes Comprehensive Guide (60+ Topics)

This guide covers Kubernetes from basics to advanced topics with commands, YAML, and real-world use cases.

---

# ðŸ“– Section 1: Fundamentals

## 1. Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It runs across clusters of machines and ensures reliability and scalability.

### Command
```bash
kubectl version --client
```

**Use case:** Run applications reliably in hybrid or cloud environments.

---

## 2. Kubernetes Architecture
Consists of Control Plane (API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager) and Worker Nodes (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime).

### Command
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

**Use case:** Master-worker separation for scalability and resilience.

---

## 3. Pods
Smallest deployable unit, encapsulating containers with shared storage and network.

### YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

**Use case:** Run one or more tightly coupled containers.

---

## 4. Pod Lifecycle & Restart Policies
Pods can restart containers based on policies: Always, OnFailure, Never.

### YAML
```yaml
restartPolicy: OnFailure
```

**Use case:** Ensure fault tolerance by restarting failed workloads.

---

## 5. Init Containers
Special containers that run before the main app container.

### YAML
```yaml
initContainers:
- name: init-myservice
  image: busybox
  command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Initializing...']
```

**Use case:** Wait for dependencies before starting the app.

---

## 6. Sidecar Containers
Additional containers providing services like logging, monitoring, or proxy.

**Use case:** Attach log collectors or service mesh proxies.

---

## 7. Ephemeral Containers
Temporary containers injected into a Pod for debugging.

```bash
kubectl debug -it nginx-pod --image=busybox
```

**Use case:** Debug running Pods without restarting them.

---

## 8. ReplicaSets
Ensure a specific number of Pod replicas are always running.

### YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

**Use case:** Maintain high availability.
