Of course. Becoming a DevOps engineer requires deep familiarity with the Linux command line. This is not just about knowing commands, but about understanding how to use them together to troubleshoot, automate, and manage systems.

Here is a categorized list of essential Linux hands-on commands, complete with common flags and use cases.

---

### **1. Navigation and File Management**

These are your basic tools for moving around and managing files.

*   `pwd` - **Print Working Directory**. Shows your current directory path.
*   `ls` - **List** directory contents.
    *   `ls -l` - Long list format (shows permissions, owner, size, etc.).
    *   `ls -a` - Show all files, including hidden ones (starting with `.`).
    *   `ls -lh` - Long list with human-readable file sizes (e.g., K, M, G).
*   `cd` - **Change Directory**.
    *   `cd /path/to/dir` - Go to absolute path.
    *   `cd ..` - Go up one directory level.
    *   `cd ~` or just `cd` - Go to your home directory.
    *   `cd -` - Go to the previous directory.
*   `mkdir` - **Make Directory**.
    *   `mkdir new_dir`
    *   `mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild` - Create nested directories.
*   `touch` - Create an empty file or update a file's timestamp. `touch file.txt`
*   `cp` - **Copy** files/directories.
    *   `cp source.txt dest.txt`
    *   `cp -r source_dir/ dest_dir/` - Recursive copy for directories.
*   `mv` - **Move** or rename files/directories. `mv old.txt new.txt`
*   `rm` - **Remove** files/directories. **(Use with extreme caution!)**
    *   `rm file.txt`
    *   `rm -r directory/` - Recursive remove for directories.
    *   `rm -rf directory/` - **Force** recursive remove (no confirmation prompts).
*   `find` - **Find** files/directories. Powerful for searching.
    *   `find /path -name "*.log"` - Find files by name.
    *   `find . -type f -mtime +7` - Find files modified more than 7 days ago.
    *   `find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \;` - Find and delete all `.tmp` files.

### **2. Viewing and Editing Files**

*   `cat` - **Concatenate** and print file content to screen. Good for small files. `cat file.conf`
*   `less` / `more` - View file content one page at a time. (`less` is more feature-rich). `less large_file.log`
*   `head` - Show the first **N** lines of a file (default 10). `head -20 file.log`
*   `tail` - Show the last **N** lines of a file (default 10). Critical for logs.
    *   `tail -f /var/log/syslog` - **Follow** mode. Continuously outputs new lines as they are written to the file. **Essential for real-time log monitoring.**
*   `grep` - **Global Regular Expression Print**. Search for patterns in text. **A DevOps superstar.**
    *   `grep "error" logfile.log` - Search for the word "error".
    *   `grep -i "warning" logfile.log` - Case-*insensitive* search.
    *   `grep -r "localhost" /etc/` - Recursively search in a directory.
    *   `ps aux | grep "nginx"` - Often used to filter process lists.
*   `vim` / `nano` - Text editors. You must be proficient in at least one. `vim` is powerful; `nano` is simpler.

### **3. System Monitoring and Process Management**

*   `ps` - **Process Status**. Snapshot of current processes.
    *   `ps aux` - View all running processes (a common and useful combination of flags).
*   `top` / `htop` - Interactive, real-time **process monitors**. `htop` is a more user-friendly upgrade. (You may need to install it: `sudo apt install htop`).
*   `free` - Check **memory** (RAM) usage.
    *   `free -h` - Human-readable output.
*   `df` - Check **disk space** on filesystems.
    *   `df -h` - Human-readable output.
*   `du` - Check **disk usage** of files/directories.
    *   `du -sh /path/to/dir` - Summary (`-s`) in human-readable (`-h`) format of a directory's size.
*   `kill` - Terminate processes by **PID** (Process ID).
    *   `kill 1234` - Graceful termination.
    *   `kill -9 1234` - Forceful termination (SIGKILL). Use as a last resort.

### **4. Networking**

*   `ping` - Test network connectivity to a host. `ping google.com`
*   `curl` / `wget` - Transfer data from/to a server. Essential for API testing and downloading files.
    *   `curl -o file.txt http://example.com/file`
    *   `curl -I http://example.com` - Fetch headers only.
*   `ss` / `netstat` - Investigate sockets and network statistics. `ss` is modern.
    *   `ss -tuln` - Show all listening (`-l`) TCP (`-t`) and UDP (`-u`) ports, with numeric (`-n`) addresses.
*   `dig` / `nslookup` - DNS lookup tools. `dig` is more powerful.
    *   `dig example.com` - Get DNS info for a domain.
    *   `dig @8.8.8.8 example.com` - Query a specific DNS server.

---

### **5. User and Permission Management**

Linux permissions are crucial for security.

*   `sudo` - Execute a command as the **superuser** (root).
*   `chmod` - **Change mode** (permissions) of a file.
    *   `chmod +x script.sh` - Make a file executable.
    *   `chmod 755 script.sh` - Numeric mode: user=rwx, group=rx, others=rx.
*   `chown` - **Change ownership** of a file.
    *   `chown user:group file.txt` - Change both user and group owner.

---

### **6. Archives and Compression**

*   `tar` - **Tape Archive**. The standard tool for bundling files.
    *   `tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/dir/` - **C**reate a **z**ipped (gzip), **v**erbose, **f**ile named `archive.tar.gz` from a directory.
    *   `tar -xzvf archive.tar.gz` - E**x**tract a zipped tar archive.
*   `gzip` / `gunzip` - Compression/Decompression tools.

---

### **7. The Power of Pipes and Redirection**

This is the core philosophy of Linux: small tools that do one job well, chained together.

*   `|` (Pipe) - Takes the **output** of one command and uses it as the **input** for the next.
    *   `cat log.txt | grep "error" | wc -l` - Count how many lines contain "error".
*   `>` (Redirect) - Redirects **output** to a file, **overwriting** it.
    *   `ls -la > file_list.txt` - Save directory listing to a file.
*   `>>` (Append Redirect) - Redirects **output** to a file, **appending** to it.
    *   `echo "new entry" >> log.txt`

### **How to Practice:**

1.  **Use it Daily:** Do everything possible through the terminal on your own Linux machine or VM.
2.  **Break Things:** Intentionally break a test server and use these commands to figure out why.
    *   Is the disk full? (`df -h`)
    *   Is the service running? (`ps aux | grep nginx`)
    *   What do the logs say? (`tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`)
    *   Can I reach the port? (`ss -tuln | grep :80`)
3.  **Learn Bash Scripting:** Start automating simple tasks by putting these commands into scripts (`.sh` files).
