Got it 👍 — you’re looking for **professional, domain-specific vocabulary** to use in DevOps, so your English sounds more natural and advanced in technical discussions. I’ll give you a list of terms/phrases like *gracefully* and *housed*, along with when to use them:

---

## 🔑 Useful Professional Terms in DevOps Context

### System & Application Behavior

* **Gracefully stopped / terminated** → shutdown without errors or data loss.
* **Abruptly killed** → forcefully stopped without cleanup.
