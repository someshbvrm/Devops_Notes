### **1. Core Concepts & Fundamentals**

**Q1. What is Terraform?**
**A:** Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language (HCL or JSON).

**Q2. What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?**
**A:** IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. It brings automation, version control, and reproducibility to infrastructure management.

**Q3. How does Terraform differ from Ansible?**
**A:**
*   **Terraform** is primarily a **provisioning** tool. It is declarative and focuses on creating, updating, and destroying infrastructure resources (e.g., VMs, networks, buckets). Its state management is a core feature.
*   **Ansible** is primarily a **configuration management** tool. It is imperative/agentless and focuses on configuring and managing software on existing servers (e.g., installing packages, starting services).

**Q4. What are the key benefits of using Terraform?**
**A:**
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Version control, reuse, and documentation.
*   **Execution Plans (`terraform plan`):** Predicts changes before applying.
*   **Resource Graph:** Builds and optimizes dependencies, parallelizing operations where possible.
*   **Change Automation:** Reduces human error and applies complex changesets efficiently.
*   **Multi-Cloud & Provider Agnostic:** Manages resources across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hundreds of others with a consistent workflow.

**Q5. Explain the declarative vs. imperative approach in the context of Terraform.**
**A:** Terraform is **declarative**. You define the desired end-state of your infrastructure (e.g., "I want 2 web servers"). Terraform's job is to figure out the sequence of API calls to make to achieve that state. You don't write the step-by-step commands to create them (which would be imperative).

**Q6. What is a Terraform Provider?**
**A:** A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to interact with a cloud provider, SaaS platform, or other API. Each provider adds a set of resource types and data sources. Examples: `aws`, `azurerm`, `google`, `kubernetes`, `null`.

**Q7. What is a Terraform Resource?**
**A:** A resource is the most important element in the Terraform language. Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects (e.g., `aws_instance`, `google_sql_database_instance`).

**Q8. What is HCL?**
**A:** HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is a structured configuration language that is both human-readable and machine-friendly. It is designed for use with tools like Terraform. Terraform also supports JSON syntax.

**Q9. What is the typical file structure of a Terraform project?**
**A:**
*   `main.tf` - Main configuration file containing resource definitions.
*   `variables.tf` - Input variable definitions.
*   `outputs.tf` - Output values to be displayed after `apply`.
*   `terraform.tfvars` or `*.auto.tfvars` - Files to set variable values automatically.
*   `versions.tf` or `provider.tf` - File to specify required provider versions.

**Q10. What is the single most important source of documentation for Terraform?**
**A:** The official Terraform Registry documentation: `https://registry.terraform.io/`. It provides complete documentation for all providers, resources, data sources, and modules.

---

### **2. Installation, Setup, & Configuration (CLI & Backends)**

**Q11. How do you install Terraform?**
**A:** Download the appropriate binary from the Terraform website (`https://www.terraform.io/downloads`), unzip it, and move it to a directory included in your system's `PATH`.

**Q12. What is the first command you run in a new Terraform directory?**
**A:** `terraform init`. This command initializes the working directory, downloads the required provider plugins, and sets up the backend.

**Q13. What does `terraform init` do?**
**A:**
*   Downloads and installs the providers defined in your configuration.
*   Creates a `.terraform` directory with the plugins and modules.
*   Configures the backend for storing state.

**Q14. What is a Terraform Backend?**
**A:** A backend defines how Terraform state is loaded and how an operation like `apply` is executed. It determines where the state file (`terraform.tfstate`) is stored (e.g., locally or remotely in S3, Azure Storage, GCS, Terraform Cloud).

**Q15. What is the difference between local and remote backends?**
**A:**
*   **Local Backend (default):** The state file is stored on the local filesystem. Not suitable for teamwork.
*   **Remote Backend:** The state file is stored in a remote, shared store like S3 or Terraform Cloud. This enables state locking and collaboration.

**Q16. What is State Locking and why is it critical?**
**A:** State locking prevents multiple users from running `terraform apply` on the same state file at the same time, which could lead to corruption and conflicts. Remote backends like S3 with DynamoDB, or Terraform Cloud, support this feature.

**Q17. How do you configure a remote backend? (e.g., AWS S3)**
**A:** In a `backend` block (usually in `main.tf` or a separate file like `backend.tf`).
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "path/to/my/key/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table" # For state locking
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```
*You must run `terraform init` again after adding a backend configuration.*

**Q18. Can you change a backend configuration after initialization?**
**A:** Yes, but you must run `terraform init` again. Terraform will detect the change and ask if you want to migrate the existing state to the new backend.

**Q19. What is the `.terraform` directory?**
**A:** It is a local directory created by `terraform init` that contains the downloaded provider plugins, modules, and a pointer to the current backend.

**Q20. What is the purpose of the `required_providers` block?**
**A:** It specifies which providers are required for the configuration and allows you to constrain the acceptable version numbers for each provider.
```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

---

### **3. Basic Commands & Workflow (Init, Plan, Apply, Destroy)**

**Q21. Describe the core Terraform workflow.**
**A:** `Write` -> `Plan` -> `Apply`.
1.  **Write:** Author infrastructure code in `.tf` files.
2.  **Init:** Run `terraform init` to initialize the directory.
3.  **Plan:** Run `terraform plan` to create an execution plan, previewing changes.
4.  **Apply:** Run `terraform apply` to execute the plan and provision real infrastructure.
5.  **(Destroy):** Run `terraform destroy` to tear down the managed infrastructure.

**Q22. What is the purpose of `terraform plan`?**
**A:** It creates an execution plan. It shows what actions Terraform will take to change your infrastructure to match the configuration. It's a dry run that allows you to review changes before applying them.

**Q23. What does the `+`, `-`, and `~` sign mean in a `terraform plan` output?**
**A:**
*   `+` (green): A resource will be **created**.
*   `-` (red): A resource will be **destroyed**.
*   `~` (yellow): A resource will be **updated in-place**.
*   `-/+` (red/green): A resource will be **replaced** (destroyed and then created).

**Q24. What is the difference between `terraform apply` and `terraform apply -auto-approve`?**
**A:** `terraform apply` will show the plan and prompt for approval before making any changes. `terraform apply -auto-approve` skips the interactive approval and applies the plan immediately.

**Q25. What does `terraform destroy` do?**
**A:** It is a command that destroys all the remote objects managed by the Terraform configuration in the current directory/state. It is the inverse of `terraform apply`.

**Q26. How can you target a specific resource for destruction?**
**A:** Use the `-target` flag. *Use this sparingly, as it can create state drift.*
```bash
terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.web
```

**Q27. How do you format your Terraform configuration files?**
**A:** Use the `terraform fmt` command. It rewrites Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.

**Q28. How do you validate the syntax of your Terraform files?**
**A:** Use the `terraform validate` command. It checks whether a configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent.

**Q29. What is the `terraform refresh` command?**
**A:** It reconciles the state Terraform knows about with the real-world infrastructure. It updates the state file with any metadata from the provider. This command is now largely deprecated, as `terraform plan` and `apply` automatically perform a refresh.

**Q30. How do you see the current state of your managed infrastructure?**
**A:** Use the `terraform show` command. It provides human-readable output from the state file.

---

### **4. Configuration Syntax (HCL): Variables, Outputs, Locals, Data Sources**

**Q31. What are Input Variables? How do you define them?**
**A:** Input variables are parameters for a Terraform module, allowing aspects to be customized without altering the module's source code. They are defined in a `variables.tf` file.
```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = "t3.micro"
}
```

**Q32. What are the available variable types?**
**A:** `string`, `number`, `bool`, `list(<TYPE>)`, `set(<TYPE>)`, `map(<TYPE>)`, `tuple([<TYPE>, ...])`, `object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ...})`.

**Q33. How can you assign values to variables?**
**A:**
1.  **Command Line:** `terraform apply -var="instance_type=t3.large"`
2.  **Variable Definition Files (`.tfvars`):** Create a file like `terraform.tfvars` or `dev.tfvars` and use `terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars"`.
3.  **Environment Variables:** Prefix with `TF_VAR_` (e.g., `TF_VAR_instance_type=t3.large`).
4.  **UI Input (default):** If no value is provided, Terraform will prompt for it.

**Q34. What are Output Values?**
**A:** Outputs are like the return values of a module. They expose values from your resources for other configurations to use or display to the CLI after deployment.
```hcl
output "instance_public_ip" {
  description = "The public IP of the web server"
  value       = aws_instance.web.public_ip
}
```

**Q35. What are Local Values (`locals`)?**
**A:** Locals are like temporary variables within a module. They simplify complex expressions and avoid repetition. They are defined in a `locals` block.
```hcl
locals {
  name_prefix = "${var.environment}-${var.project_name}"
  common_tags = {
    Owner       = "DevOps"
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
```

**Q36. What is a Data Source?**
**A:** A data source allows Terraform to fetch information from a provider that is not managed by the current configuration. It is a way to use information about existing infrastructure (e.g., an AMI ID, a VPC ID).
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["099720109477"] # Canonical

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }
}

# Usage: data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
```

**Q37. What is the difference between a Resource and a Data Source?**
**A:**
*   **Resource:** `resource` blocks define infrastructure that Terraform **manages** (creates, updates, deletes).
*   **Data Source:** `data` blocks define infrastructure that Terraform **reads** from and uses, but does not manage (it already exists).

**Q38. How do you reference an attribute from a resource?**
**A:** The syntax is `<RESOURCE TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>`. For example, to get the ID of an AWS instance: `aws_instance.web.id`.

**Q39. What is string interpolation in Terraform?**
**A:** It is the process of including variable or expression values within a string. It uses the `${...}` syntax.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.environment}-web-server"
  }
}
```

**Q40. What is a HEREDOC and why is it used?**
**A:** A HEREDOC is a multi-line string. It's often used for policies, scripts, or large blocks of text to maintain readability.
```hcl
user_data = <<-EOT
  #!/bin/bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y nginx
  sudo systemctl start nginx
EOT
```

---

### **5. Resources & Providers**

**Q41. How do you define a provider?**
**A:** In a `provider` block. You typically configure it with credentials and region.
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  # Credentials are best set via environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
}
```

**Q42. How do you use multiple configurations of the same provider? (e.g., multiple AWS regions)**
**A:** Use alias.
```hcl
# Default provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Aliased provider
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "west"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Use the aliased provider in a resource
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "log_bucket" {
  provider = aws.west
  bucket   = "my-logs-bucket"
}
```

**Q43. What are the different ways to authenticate the AWS provider?**
**A:**
1.  **Static Credentials:** `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` in the provider block (not recommended).
2.  **Environment Variables:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
3.  **Shared Credentials File:** `~/.aws/credentials`.
4.  **EC2 Instance Profile/IAM Roles:** (Most secure for EC2).
5.  **AWS CLI:** If you have `aws configure` set up, Terraform will use those credentials.

**Q44. What is the `depends_on` meta-argument used for?**
**A:** It explicitly defines a dependency between resources that Terraform cannot automatically infer. This is a last resort, as Terraform's graph usually handles dependencies correctly through references.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...
  depends_on = [aws_iam_role_policy.example]
}
```

**Q45. What are the lifecycle meta-arguments?**
**A:** The `lifecycle` block within a resource can change how Terraform manages the resource's lifecycle.
*   `create_before_destroy`: Ensures a new resource is created before the old one is destroyed (good for zero-downtime updates).
*   `prevent_destroy`: Prevents the resource from being destroyed (adds a safety flag).
*   `ignore_changes`: Instructs Terraform to ignore changes to specific attributes (e.g., `ignore_changes = [tags]`).

**Q46. How do you reference a resource attribute from another module?**
**A:** The syntax is `module.<MODULE NAME>.<OUTPUT NAME>`.
```hcl
# In the module call
module "network" {
  source = "./modules/network"
}

# Referencing the module's output
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  subnet_id = module.network.public_subnet_id
}
```

**Q47. What is the `count` meta-argument?**
**A:** It creates multiple instances of a resource based on a number.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server-${count.index}"
  }
}
```

**Q48. What is the `for_each` meta-argument?**
**A:** It creates multiple instances of a resource based on a map or set of strings. It is often preferred over `count` for stability, as adding an item to a set doesn't change the indices of all other items.
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  for_each = toset(["user1", "user2", "user3"])
  name     = each.key
}

# Referencing: aws_iam_user.example["user1"].arn
```

**Q49. What is the difference between `count` and `for_each`?**
**A:**
*   **`count`:** Creates resources based on an integer. Best for identical, sequential resources. Resource addresses are `aws_instance.web[0]`, `aws_instance.web[1]`.
*   **`for_each`:** Creates resources based on a map or set. Best for distinct resources that need a unique key. Resource addresses are `aws_iam_user.example["user1"]`, `aws_iam_user.example["user2"]`.

**Q50. What is the `terraform_remote_state` data source?**
**A:** It is a special data source that allows you to read the state file from another Terraform configuration. This is one way to share data between configurations (e.g., a network module outputting VPC ID, and an app module reading it).
```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "network" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "my-state-bucket"
    key    = "network/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Usage: data.terraform_remote_state.network.outputs.vpc_id
```

---

### **6. State Management (`terraform.tfstate`)**

**Q51. What is the `terraform.tfstate` file?**
**A:** It is a JSON file that maps your Terraform configuration to the real-world infrastructure. It keeps track of resource metadata and dependencies. It is the **single source of truth** for your Terraform-managed infrastructure.

**Q52. Why is the state file crucial?**
**A:** It allows Terraform to know what resources it manages, their current settings, and their relationships. Without it, Terraform would not know which real-world objects correspond to the resources in your configuration.

**Q53. Why should you never manually edit the state file?**
**A:** Manual edits can corrupt the state, breaking the link between configuration and real infrastructure. Instead, use the `terraform state` commands for any state manipulation.

**Q54. What does `terraform state list` do?**
**A:** It lists all resources tracked in the state file.

**Q55. How do you remove a resource from the state file without destroying it?**
**A:** Use `terraform state rm`. This is useful if you want to move a resource to a different state file or stop managing it with Terraform without destroying it.
```bash
terraform state rm aws_instance.web
```

**Q56. How do you import existing infrastructure into Terraform state?**
**A:** Use `terraform import`. You must first write a resource block for it in your configuration, then import it.
```bash
terraform import aws_instance.my_web_server i-12345abcd # i-12345abcd is the EC2 instance ID
```

**Q57. What are the challenges with `terraform import`?**
**A:** It only imports the resource into the state file. It does not generate the corresponding Terraform configuration code (`HCL`). You must manually write the resource block to match the imported resource's settings.

**Q58. What is "state drift"?**
**A:** State drift occurs when the real-world infrastructure changes from what is defined in the Terraform state file. This can happen if someone manually changes a resource (e.g., resizes an instance via the AWS console). Running `terraform plan` will detect this drift.

**Q59. How does Terraform handle state drift?**
**A:** `terraform plan` will show the difference between the state file and real infrastructure. Running `terraform apply` will then revert the real infrastructure to match the configuration defined in your `.tf` files.

**Q60. What is a partial configuration for a backend?**
**A:** It's when you omit some parameters from the backend block (like S3 bucket name) and provide them later via `-backend-config` CLI arguments or a file during `terraform init`. This is useful for keeping secrets out of version control.
```bash
terraform init -backend-config="bucket=my-terraform-bucket" -backend-config="key=prod/terraform.tfstate"
```

---

### **7. Modules**

**Q61. What is a Terraform Module?**
**A:** A module is a container for multiple resources that are used together. Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, the **root module**. Modules allow you to group resources logically and reuse them.

**Q62. What are the benefits of using modules?**
**A:** **Reusability, Encapsulation, Organization, and Consistency.** You can write a module once and use it across multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) with different parameters.

**Q63. How do you call a module?**
**A:** Use a `module` block.
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.14.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  # ... other parameters
}
```

**Q64. What are the possible sources for a module?**
**A:**
*   **Local Paths:** `source = "./modules/vpc"`
*   **Terraform Registry:** `source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"`
*   **Git:** `source = "git::https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-vpc.git"`
*   **HTTP URLs:** `source = "https://example.com/vpc-module.zip"`
*   **S3/GCS Buckets:** `source = "s3::https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket/vpc.zip"`

**Q65. What is the public Terraform Registry?**
**A:** It is a public repository of reusable modules and providers maintained by HashiCorp and the community. (`https://registry.terraform.io/`).

**Q66. What happens when you run `terraform get`?**
**A:** It downloads and updates modules mentioned in the configuration. It is automatically run by commands like `plan` and `apply`, so you rarely need to run it manually.

**Q67. What are module outputs?**
**A:** They are the return values of a module. They are defined in the module's `outputs.tf` file and are used to expose values from the module's resources to the calling module.

**Q68. What are input variables for a module?**
**A:** They are the parameters you pass into a module to customize it, defined in the module's `variables.tf` file.

**Q69. What is a "root module"?**
**A:** The root module is the current working directory where you run `terraform apply`. It may call other modules (child modules), but it is itself a module.

**Q70. What is the difference between a module and a provider?**
**A:** A **provider** is a plugin that offers a set of resource types (e.g., `aws_instance`). A **module** is a collection of resources (from one or more providers) packaged together for reuse.

---

### **8. Workspaces**

**Q71. What are Terraform Workspaces?**
**A:** Workspaces allow you to manage multiple distinct state files within the same Terraform configuration directory. They are a way to manage different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) from the same codebase.

**Q72. How do you create a new workspace?**
**A:**
```bash
terraform workspace new dev
```

**Q73. How do you list all workspaces?**
**A:**
```bash
terraform workspace list
```

**Q74. How do you switch workspaces?**
**A:**
```bash
terraform workspace select dev
```

**Q75. Where is the state stored for non-default workspaces?**
**A:** For local backends, each workspace gets its own state file: `terraform.tfstate.d/<WORKSPACE_NAME>/terraform.tfstate`. For remote backends like S3, the state file key is typically prefixed with the workspace name: `env:/<WORKSPACE_NAME>/path/to/state`.

**Q76. What is a common use case for workspaces?**
**A:** Managing multiple short-lived, similar environments (e.g., feature branches, development environments). They are *not* recommended for managing fundamentally different environments (like dev vs. prod) because they use the same code and providers. For that, use separate directories and root modules.

**Q77. How can you use a variable value that is specific to a workspace?**
**A:** You can use the `${terraform.workspace}` interpolation sequence in your configuration.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  tags = {
    Name = "web-server-${terraform.workspace}"
  }
}
```

**Q78. What is the name of the default workspace?**
**A:** `default`.

**Q79. How do you delete a workspace?**
**A:** First, switch to another workspace, then delete it. You cannot delete the current workspace.
```bash
terraform workspace select default
terraform workspace delete dev
```

**Q80. What is a major limitation of workspaces?**
**A:** They all share the same backend configuration and Terraform code. This means you cannot have different versions of providers or modules per workspace, which can be a problem for managing truly isolated environments like production.

---

### **9. Provisioners**

**Q81. What are Provisioners?**
**A:** Provisioners are a last-resort option to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or destruction. They are used for specific actions that aren't natively supported by providers.

**Q82. Why are provisioners considered a "last resort"?**
**A:** They introduce procedural steps into a declarative workflow, which can be less reliable and harder to debug. It's always better to use native provider features (like `user_data` for EC2) or dedicated tools like Ansible/Packer if possible.

**Q83. What are the main types of provisioners?**
**A:**
*   **`file`:** Copies a file or directory from the machine running Terraform to the newly created resource.
*   **`local-exec`:** Executes a command on the machine running Terraform.
*   **`remote-exec`:** Executes commands on the newly created resource (typically via SSH or WinRM).

**Q84. How do you use a `local-exec` provisioner?**
**A:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.private_ip} >> private_ips.txt"
  }
}
```

**Q85. How do you use a `remote-exec` provisioner?**
**A:** You need to define a connection block.
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Connection info for SSH
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx",
      "sudo systemctl start nginx",
    ]
  }
}
```

**Q86. What are the `on_failure` behaviors for a provisioner?**
**A:**
*   `on_failure = fail` (default): Marks the resource as tainted and fails the apply.
*   `on_failure = continue`: Ignores the error and continues with creation. The resource is marked as tainted.

**Q87. What is a "tainted" resource?**
**A:** A resource marked as tainted means that it will be destroyed and recreated on the next `terraform apply`. This happens if a provisioner fails during its creation.

**Q88. How can you manually mark a resource as tainted?**
**A:** Use the `terraform taint` command. This forces the resource to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply.
```bash
terraform taint aws_instance.web
```

**Q89. How can you manually un-taint a resource?**
**A:** Use the `terraform untaint` command.
```bash
terraform untaint aws_instance.web
```

**Q90. What is a `null_resource`?**
**A:** It is a resource that does nothing itself but can have provisioners attached to it. It's useful for triggering provisioners based on other changes in your configuration.
```hcl
resource "null_resource" "cluster" {
  # Changes to any value in this list will trigger this null_resource
  triggers = {
    always_run = timestamp() # Force run on every apply
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Triggered at ${timestamp()}'"

### **10. Debugging & Troubleshooting**

**Q91. How do you enable verbose logging for Terraform?**
**A:** Set the `TF_LOG` environment variable.
*   `TF_LOG=TRACE` (Most verbose)
*   `TF_LOG=DEBUG`
*   `TF_LOG=INFO`
*   `TF_LOG=WARN`
*   `TF_LOG=ERROR`
You can also use `TF_LOG_PATH=./terraform.log` to write logs to a file.

**Q92. You run `terraform plan` and get a "provider authentication" error. What are the first things to check?**
**A:**
1.  Are your cloud provider credentials set correctly? (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
2.  Do the credentials have the necessary permissions?
3.  Is the correct region configured in the provider block?

**Q93. Your `terraform apply` fails with a timeout error. What could be the cause?**
**A:** The resource creation might be taking longer than the provider's default timeout. You can often increase the timeout in the resource configuration.
```hcl
resource "aws_db_instance" "default" {
  # ...
  timeouts {
    create = "60m"
    delete = "60m"
  }
}
```

**Q94. You get a state lock error. What does it mean and how do you resolve it?**
**A:** It means another process is holding a lock on the state file (likely another `terraform apply` running elsewhere). **First, ensure no one else is running Terraform.** If you are sure the process is dead, you can force unlock the state (use with extreme caution!).
```bash
terraform force-unlock LOCK_ID
# The LOCK_ID is provided in the error message.
```

**Q95. `terraform plan` shows a lot of changes you didn't expect. What should you do?**
**A:**
1.  **Check for state drift:** Did someone change infrastructure manually?
2.  **Check your configuration:** Did you recently update a module or provider version?
3.  **Use `-refresh-only` flag:** Run `terraform plan -refresh-only` to see what Terraform detects as drift without proposing to change it back.

**Q96. How do you handle errors related to eventual consistency in cloud APIs?**
**A:** Some cloud APIs (like AWS IAM) are eventually consistent. A resource might be created but not immediately available. You can handle this by:
1.  Adding a `depends_on` to force Terraform to wait.
2.  Using `terraform retry` scripts or `sleep` in provisioners (not ideal).
3.  Using a `null_resource` with a trigger that depends on the new resource, and a `local-exec` that retries a check.

**Q97. What does the error "Error: Invalid for_each argument" typically mean?**
**A:** The value passed to `for_each` is not a map or set of strings. You might need to convert a list using `toset()`.
```hcl
# Wrong
for_each = var.list_of_names

# Right
for_each = toset(var.list_of_names)
```

**Q98. How do you troubleshoot a failing provisioner?**
**A:**
1.  Enable `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to see the exact commands and output.
2.  For `remote-exec`, ensure the connection block (SSH keys, security groups) is correct.
3.  Check the script you are trying to run independently.

**Q99. Your plan shows a resource will be replaced, but you don't want that. How can you prevent it?**
**A:** Use the `lifecycle` meta-argument `ignore_changes` to ignore the attribute that is forcing the replacement (e.g., a tag that is auto-generated by the cloud provider).
```hcl
lifecycle {
  ignore_changes = [tags["CreatedBy"]]
}
```

**Q100. You need to rename a resource. How can you do it without destroying and recreating it?**
**A:** Terraform identifies resources by their address. To rename:
1.  **Step 1:** Run `terraform state mv` to rename the resource in the state file.
    ```bash
    terraform state mv aws_instance.old_name aws_instance.new_name
    ```
2.  **Step 2:** Update the resource name in your configuration file (`main.tf`) to match the new name.
This tells Terraform the existing object should now be managed under a new name.

### **11. Security & Secrets Management**

**Q101. Why is it a bad practice to hardcode secrets in Terraform files?**
**A:** Terraform files are often stored in version control (Git). Hardcoded secrets would be exposed to anyone with access to the repository.

**Q102. What are the recommended ways to handle secrets in Terraform?**
**A:**
1.  **Environment Variables:** For provider credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`).
2.  **Secret Stores Integration:** Use `vault` provider to dynamically get secrets from HashiCorp Vault.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline Variables:** Store secrets in your CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI Variables) and pass them as environment variables or `tfvars` files.
4.  **Ignored `.tfvars` Files:** Use a `secrets.tfvars` file that is added to `.gitignore` and passed via `-var-file`.

**Q103. How do you use HashiCorp Vault with Terraform?**
**A:** Use the `vault` provider as a data source to retrieve secrets.
```hcl
provider "vault" {
  # Vault address/auth configured via env vars VAULT_ADDR, VAULT_TOKEN
}

data "vault_generic_secret" "example" {
  path = "secret/data/myapp"
}

# Then use the secret in a resource
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  user_data = <<EOF
export DB_PASSWORD="${data.vault_generic_secret.example.data["db_password"]}"
EOF
}
```

**Q104. How can you ensure your state file is encrypted?**
**A:** By using a remote backend that supports encryption at rest. For example, AWS S3 with Server-Side Encryption (SSE) enabled, or Azure Storage with encryption.

**Q105. What is the risk of storing state files remotely, and how do you mitigate it?**
**A:** The state file contains all resource data, including potential secrets (e.g., database passwords in plaintext). **Mitigation:**
*   Use a backend with encryption at rest.
*   Use strict IAM/access policies to limit who can access the state bucket.
*   Never enable public access on the state bucket.
*   Use tools like `sops` or `git-crypt` to encrypt sensitive values in the state file (advanced).

**Q106. How can you limit the permissions of the Terraform IAM user/service principal?**
**A:** Follow the **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**. Create a custom IAM policy that grants only the specific permissions needed to create/manage the resources in your Terraform configuration, rather than using broad policies like `AdministratorAccess`.

**Q107. What is Sentinel in the context of Terraform?**
**A:** Sentinel is a policy-as-code framework integrated with Terraform Enterprise and Cloud. It allows you to define fine-grained, logic-based policies that are enforced on Terraform runs (e.g., "All EC2 instances must be of type t3.*", "No resources can be created in us-east-1").

**Q108. How can you prevent `terraform destroy`?**
**A:** 
1.  **Using `prevent_destroy`:** Set `prevent_destroy = true` in the `lifecycle` block of a critical resource. This will prevent `destroy` from working on that resource unless the config is first changed.
2.  **Using Terraform Cloud/Enterprise:** Use a Sentinel policy to prevent `destroy` runs.
3.  **Using CI/CD:** Configure your pipeline to not run `terraform destroy` or to require manual approval.

**Q109. How do you manage different sets of secrets for different environments?**
**A:** Use separate Vault paths, separate CI/CD pipeline variables, or separate encrypted `tfvars` files for each environment (e.g., `prod.auto.tfvars.enc`, `dev.auto.tfvars.enc`).

**Q110. What is the `external` data source?**
**A:** It allows an external program to act as a data source, returning JSON data for Terraform to use. This can be a security risk if the external program is not trusted, as it can execute arbitrary code.
```hcl
data "external" "example" {
  program = ["python", "${path.module}/example-data-source.py"]
  query = {
    # input to the program
  }
}
```

### **12. Collaboration & Best Practices**

**Q111. What is the recommended branching strategy for Terraform code?**
**A:** Use a trunk-based workflow with feature branches. All changes are made through Pull Requests (PRs) that must be approved and pass CI checks (e.g., `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`) before being merged to the main branch. The main branch should be the source of truth for your infrastructure.

**Q112. How should you structure Terraform configurations for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)?**
**A:** The two most common patterns are:
1.  **Directory-per-environment:** Each environment (dev/, staging/, prod/) is a separate root module. This allows for complete isolation, different versions, and reduces blast radius. **This is generally recommended.**
    ```
    environments/
    ├── dev/
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terraform.tfvars
    ├── staging/
    │   ├── main.tf
    │   └── terraform.tfvars
    └── prod/
        ├── main.tf
        └── terraform.tfvars
    ```
2.  **Workspace-per-environment:** Uses Terraform workspaces to manage state for each environment within the same root module. This is simpler but riskier, as all environments share the same code and provider versions.

**Q113. What should always be included in a `.gitignore` file for a Terraform project?**
**A:**
```
# Local .terraform directories
**/.terraform/*

# .tfstate files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data
*.tfvars

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Ignore CLI configuration files
.terraformrc
terraform.rc
```

**Q114. What is the purpose of pinning provider versions?**
**A:** To ensure consistency and stability. Newer provider versions might introduce breaking changes. Pinning (e.g., `version = "~> 4.0"`) prevents automatic upgrades to potentially incompatible versions.

**Q115. How do you upgrade providers and modules?**
**A:**
1.  Update the version constraint in the `required_providers` block or module `version`.
2.  Run `terraform init -upgrade`. This will download the new versions.

**Q116. What is the purpose of `terraform fmt`?**
**A:** It automatically formats your configuration files to a canonical style, ensuring consistency across the codebase. This should be run automatically in a pre-commit hook or CI pipeline.

**Q117. What should a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform do?**
**A:**
1.  **`terraform validate`:** Check for syntax errors.
2.  **`terraform fmt -check`:** Ensure code is properly formatted.
3.  **`terraform plan`:** For PRs, show a plan preview. For the main branch, the plan output can be used for approval.
4.  **`terraform apply`:** Apply the changes after manual approval or automated checks.
5.  **Run security scanning** (e.g., `tfsec`, `checkov`).
6.  **Run cost estimation** (e.g., `infracost`).

**Q118. What are tools like `tfsec` or `checkov` used for?**
**A:** They are static analysis tools that scan Terraform code for security misconfigurations and compliance violations before the infrastructure is even deployed (shift-left security).

**Q119. What is `infracost`?**
**A:** A tool that parses Terraform code and estimates the monthly cost of the infrastructure it defines. It's invaluable for cost control and can be integrated into PRs.

**Q120. What is the "break-glass" procedure for making urgent manual changes?**
**A:** If a manual change is absolutely necessary:
1.  Document the change and the reason.
2.  As soon as possible, run `terraform refresh` (or `plan/apply`) to import the change into the state.
3.  Update the Terraform configuration to reflect the new desired state so that the manual change is not reverted on the next apply.
